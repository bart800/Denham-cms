## 1. Overview

The intake process is the first point of contact for potential new clients (PNCs). Whether the call is incoming (client found us via Google or referral) or outgoing (we received client info from a referral source), the goal is to:

1. Determine if the case is one we can take
2. Gather minimum required information
3. Send the Authority to Represent (ATR) contract
4. Request supporting documents
5. Set up the file in the CMS

⚠️ **First impressions go a long way!** Always act in a professional, friendly, and helpful manner.

---

## 2. Initial Call Process

### Incoming Call
Client found us via Google, referral, or answering service message.

### Outgoing Call
We received client information from a referral source and are calling to initiate intake.

### How to Handle the Call
- Use the CMS intake form to guide questions so all required fields are captured
- Once you get the **bare minimum** info needed to send the contract, you can do so:
  - Name and contact info of all insured parties

---

## 3. Information Gathering

### 3.1 Create or Find the Lead
- **Cold call:** Create a new lead in the CMS
- **Answering service / website form:** Search by name first — the CMS usually auto-creates these

### 3.2 Capture Required Information

**Case Type:** Note whether MVA or Property Casualty in the CMS. Add key facts in the appropriate fields; add extra context in Notes.

**Date of Loss (DoL)** — Ask ASAP
- Required for the contract and for case viability
- ⚠️ **If DoL > 1 year:** Request a FULL COPY OF THEIR POLICY (not just the declaration page). Under "Suit Against Us," the policy states the filing deadline.

**Case-Type Specifics:**
- **MVA:** Record accident location, injuries, whether still treating — enter in designated fields
- **Property Casualty:** Record insured property address and type of loss

### 3.3 Contacts & Identifiers
- Collect first/last name, property address, phone, email
- If someone else is on the policy: Add as a related contact (need name, phone/email, relationship)
- If available, get claim #, policy #, and adjuster contact info

---

## 4. Case Screening Decision Tree

Use this to quickly determine if we should take a case:

```
Is it a Property Insurance case?
├── YES → Is the DOL within the SOL? (Check policy "Suit Against Us" if >1 year)
│   ├── YES → Is the estimated unpaid damage ≥ $20,000?
│   │   ├── YES → ✅ TAKE THE CASE
│   │   └── NO → Is this a PA referral's current client?
│   │       ├── YES → ✅ TAKE THE CASE (good relationship maintenance)
│   │       └── NO → ⛔ LIKELY REJECT — discuss with Bart
│   └── NO / UNKNOWN → Request full policy ASAP. Hold until confirmed.
│       └── SOL expired → ⛔ REJECT — refer to bar association
│
Is it an MVA / Personal Injury case?
├── YES → Are there injuries?
│   ├── YES → Is the SOL still good? (→ see SOP 09 state SOL table)
│   │   ├── YES → Is venue acceptable?
│   │   │   ├── YES → ✅ TAKE THE CASE
│   │   │   └── NO → ⛔ REJECT — refer to local attorney
│   │   └── NO → ⛔ REJECT
│   └── NO injuries → ⛔ REJECT — "We only handle MVA cases with injuries"
│
Is it something else (dog bite, slip & fall, etc.)?
└── Discuss with Bart before proceeding
```

## 5. Fee Structure

| Scenario | Pre-Litigation | Litigation |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Standard (non-referred) | 33% | 40% |
| PA-referred case (PA's current client) | 25% | 33% |
| PA-referred case (NOT PA's current client) | 33% | 40% |

Discuss fees with the PNC and select the appropriate fee structure in the CMS so the contract populates correctly.

---

## 6. Contract (ATR) Preparation & Sending

### 6.1 Pre-Send Checklist

**Property Casualty cases require these fields for auto-population:**
- ✅ Defendant Full Name (For Contract)
- ✅ Type of Loss
- ✅ Insured Property Address

**MVA cases require:**
- ✅ Defendant Full Name (For Contract)

**Attorney on contract:** Bart must be chosen under "Assigned to Attorney" so he appears on the contract.

### 6.2 Sending Steps

1. In the CMS, navigate to Documents and select the appropriate ATR template:
   - **Authority to Represent — Single Party** (one insured)
   - **Authority to Represent — 2 Clients** (two insureds)
2. Download and verify all auto-populated fields are correct
3. Delete the auto-inserted current date at the bottom (leave blank for Bart to fill in)
4. Save the file
5. Upload the edited document back to the CMS
6. Send for e-signature — choose text or email per client preference
7. Name the document: **"Authority to Represent — [Last Name]"**
8. Change lead status to **"Pending Signup"**

### 💡 Pro Tips — ATR
- If the client is eager, send the ATR *while still on the phone*. Walk them through signing it live — this dramatically increases conversion rate.
- For two-insured cases, make sure BOTH names populate. The CMS sometimes only pulls the primary contact.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes — ATR
- Forgetting to delete the auto-inserted date at the bottom
- Using the wrong template (single vs. two-client)
- Not selecting the correct fee structure for PA referrals (25/33 vs 33/40)
- Sending before verifying the Defendant Name field is populated

---

## 7. Follow-Up Cadence

- ✅ Follow up on signature **every 2–4 days** until signed
- All correspondence with the lead should be logged in the CMS Messages tab
- All documents should be uploaded to the CMS Documents tab

---

## 8. Document Request Emails

Send a document request email **after sending the ATR**. Send through the CMS so documentation is logged to the file.

### Property Casualty Template

> Hi Mr./Ms. [Last Name],
>
> I'm following up with you after our phone call to request the documents we need to move forward. At your earliest convenience, we ask that you send over any documentation you have regarding this claim, including correspondence with [insurance company], any estimates, photos, reports, and a copy of your policy. I look forward to hearing from you and hope you have a great rest of your day.

### MVA Template

> Hi Mr./Ms. [Last Name],
>
> I'm following up with you after our phone call to request the documents we need to move forward. At your earliest convenience, we ask that you send over any documentation you have regarding this claim, including correspondence with [defendant's insurance company] or [their insurance company], a copy of your auto policy and declaration's page, a copy of the police report, information regarding the providers you've seen, and any estimates you may have for the vehicle damage. I look forward to hearing from you and hope you have a great rest of your day.

### DoL Over 1 Year — Extra Line

> Because your loss is more than one year old, please request a full certified copy of your policy from your agent (not just the declarations page).

⚠️ **Follow up regularly**, especially after they sign, if required documents don't arrive soon.

---

## 9. File Setup in CMS

### 9.1 Convert the Lead
1. Change lead status to **"Signed Up"**
2. Post the lead to the CMS case management system
3. Change the project name to: **Last Name, First Name v. Defendant(s)**

### 9.2 Organize the File
- Use the CMS pre-made folder structure (→ see [SOP 02 § Folder Structure](02-document-collection-and-lor.md#7-folder-structure))
- Drag and drop documents into appropriate folders
- As new docs arrive, file them into the correct folder

### 9.3 OneDrive Backup
Create a folder in OneDrive: **"[Last Name], [First Name]"** with subfolders:
- Intake
- Correspondence
- Estimates
- Photos
- Policy

### 9.4 Document Naming Convention
Follow this format (→ see [SOP 02 § Naming Convention](02-document-collection-and-lor.md#6-document-naming-convention) for full details):
```
8.26.25 SF Letter re Settlement
9.1.25 LOR Smith
Certified Policy from [SF, Progressive, Allstate, etc.]
```

## 12. Scheduling Procedures

**⏱️ Expected Time: 5 minutes per appointment**

1. **Explicitly confirm** whether this is a video, phone, or in-person meeting
2. Check the attorney's calendar first — have a couple of times and dates in mind
3. **Take note of the caller's time zone** (we have clients in 16 states!)
4. Call the person and put the event on the attorney's calendar while on the phone
5. Include the person's phone number and any notes in the calendar event
6. Call the person at the scheduled time and transfer to attorney unless confirmed otherwise

### 💡 Pro Tip
Montana is Mountain Time, Arizona doesn't observe daylight saving time. Double-check time zones for out-of-state clients before scheduling.

## 13. Intake Sample Scripts

### PA Referral — Property Claim

**Scenario:** PA referred the caller. Date of Loss: 03/15/2025. Unpaid damages: ~$40,000.

**1) Greeting & Verify Referral**
> IS: Hi, this is [Your Name] with Denham Property & Injury Law Firm. Thanks for calling. I understand [PA name] referred you — does that sound right?
> PNC: Yes.
> IS: Great. Before we begin, can I confirm your full name and the best phone and email to reach you?

**2) Basic Facts & Date of Loss**
> IS: I'll gather a few details to see how we can help. What's the address of the damaged property?
> PNC: [Provides address.]
> IS: Thank you. And I have your Date of Loss as March 15, 2025 — is that correct?
> PNC: Yes.
> IS: Perfect. That helps us evaluate timelines and coverage.

**3) Loss Description & Damages**
> IS: Briefly, what happened — storm, water, fire, something else? Any reports or photos so far?
> PNC: [Explains.]
> IS: Understood. And you mentioned you still need about $40,000 to finish repairs, correct?
> PNC: Correct.
> IS: Have you received any payments from the carrier yet? Any estimates or expert reports we can review?

**4) Policy, Claim & Adjuster Details**
> IS: Which insurance company is handling the claim?
> PNC: [Carrier.]
> IS: Do you have the policy number and claim number handy? If not, no worries — we can follow up by email.
> PNC: [Provides or declines.]
> IS: And who is your adjuster with phone/email?

**5) Other Insureds / Related Contacts**
> IS: Is anyone else listed on the policy or on the deed (spouse/co-insured, etc.)?
> PNC: [Yes/No + names.]
> IS: I'll note them so they receive documents as needed.

**6) Fees (PA-Referred Case)**
> IS: Because you came through a public adjuster referral, our standard fee is 25% if we resolve before litigation and 33% if litigation is needed. There's no upfront cost to you. Does that make sense?
> PNC: Yes.

**7) E-Signature & Preferred Channel**
> IS: I'll send our Authority to Represent for e-signature now. Do you prefer text or email for the signature link?
> PNC: [Chooses.]
> IS: Perfect — and is it okay if we text/email you document reminders?
> PNC: Yes.

**8) Next Steps**
> IS: Here's what happens next:
> 1. I'll send the Authority to Represent Agreement right now.
> 2. I'll also email a document checklist (policy, estimates, photos, reports, and carrier correspondence).
> 3. Once signed, we'll open your file and send a Letter of Representation to your carrier.
> We'll keep you updated as we push to close that $40,000 gap. Sound good?

**9) Close**
> IS: Great — watch for two messages from us shortly. If you have questions, reply to that message or call us at (859) 900-BART. We look forward to helping you.

### Claim Over 1 Year Old

**Scenario:** Caller from Kentucky. Damage occurred more than 1 year ago.

**Key Explanation:**
> IS: Because your loss happened more than a year ago, Kentucky law and your insurance policy may limit the time to file suit. Most policies include a section called "Suit Against Us" that spells out the exact deadline. To see if you are still within the time limit, we'll need a complete copy of your full policy, not just the declarations page.

**If client doesn't have the full policy:**
> IS: That's very common. The easiest way to get it is to contact your insurance agent and request the full certified policy. Once you have it, you can email or text it to us.

### Rejection — Car Accident with No Injuries

> IS: I understand. At this time, our firm is only able to assist with car accident cases that involve injuries. Because yours does not, unfortunately we won't be able to take this case on.
>
> That said, I don't want to leave you without options. You may want to reach out to the [Caller's State] Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service. They can connect you with an attorney who handles property-damage-only auto claims.
>
> For example, if you're in Kentucky: https://www.kybar.org/page/LRS

- **Nice to have:** Full policy, estimates, insurance correspondence, claim/policy numbers, photos

## 15. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to ask the DOL** — This is THE most important screening question. A 3-year-old claim may be time-barred.
2. **Not checking if both spouses are on the policy** — If the policy lists two insureds, BOTH must sign the ATR.
3. **Telling the caller we'll "definitely" take their case** before screening is complete — never promise until Bart confirms.
4. **Not logging the call in the CMS** — If it's not in the system, it didn't happen.
5. **Sending the ATR before the Defendant Name field is filled** — The contract will be blank where it matters.
6. **Using the wrong fee structure** — PA referral (current client) = 25/33. Non-referred = 33/40. Getting this wrong requires a new contract.

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Send the ATR while on the phone** — Walk them through signing. Conversion rate is much higher when they sign live.
2. **Google the property address** — Street View shows roof condition, property size. Helps you understand the claim.
3. **Check the CMS before creating a new lead** — Answering service messages often auto-create leads. Duplicates cause headaches.
4. **For PA referrals, CC the PA on the document request email** — They often already have the documents and can send them faster than the client.
5. **Set a task for 48 hours after sending the ATR** — If not signed, follow up immediately. After a week, warm leads go cold.
