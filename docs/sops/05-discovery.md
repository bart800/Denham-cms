## 1. Overview

Discovery is the litigation phase where both sides exchange information and documents. When the Defendant serves discovery on us, we have **30 days from the certificate of service date** to respond. When we serve discovery on the Defendant, they have the same obligation.

⚠️ **For RFAs:** If we don't answer within the time frame, all requests are **considered admitted by default.**

---

## 2. Types of Discovery

| Type | Abbreviation | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Request for Admissions | RFA | Defendant asks us to admit or deny specific statements |
| Interrogatories | INT | Defendant asks specific questions about the case |
| Request for Production of Documents | RFPD | Defendant requests specific documents |

## 3. Receiving Discovery — Immediate Steps

When discovery is received:

1. **Calendar the deadline:** 30 days from the date on the certificate of service
   - Add a **reminder 10 days before** the deadline, sent to Bart
2. **Request a Word document** from Opposing Counsel (OC) if discovery was not received in an editable format
3. **Send discovery to the client** via email:
   - Explain what discovery is
   - Advise them we need their help answering within **7 days**
4. **Call the client** to explain and provide clarification on what information is needed
   - Guide them on how to locate and provide requested documents
   - Document all communications in the CMS Activity section
5. **Standardize document formatting** while waiting for client responses (see [Section 10](#10-formatting-standards))
6. **Begin answering** routine/common questions with information available in the case file

## 4. Answering Requests for Admissions (RFAs)

### General Strategy

⚠️ **Try to deny everything**, except when you absolutely must admit.

- We usually admit to plaintiffs signing contracts with construction defect clients
- Insurance companies generally ask the same questions across cases

### Common RFA Questions (Insurance Cases)

> REQUEST NO. 1: Please admit or deny that the amount in controversy for the claims of the Plaintiffs for breach of contract as alleged in Count I of the Complaint does not exceed $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

> REQUEST NO. 2: Please admit or deny that the amount in controversy for the claims of the Plaintiffs against [Carrier] for violation of the Kentucky Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, KRS 304.12-230 as alleged in Count II of the Complaint does not exceed $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

> REQUEST NO. 3: Please admit or deny that the aggregate of the claims contained in the Plaintiffs' Complaint against [Carrier], including but not limited to the claim for breach of contract in Count I and for violation of KRS 304.12-230 in Count II, do not exceed $75,000, inclusive of statutory interest and attorney fees but exclusive of non-statutory interest and attorney fees.

These are admitted or denied **depending on the case.**

### Objection Templates

You can object to an RFA if it is an impermissible compound question that calls for a legal conclusion:

> **REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 3:** Admit or deny that Defendants did not cause any termite damage to your residence.
>
> **ANSWER:** Objection, impermissible compound question and calls for legal conclusion that there was termite damage to the Property. Denied.

### Tips
- Review other RFA answers from similar cases for reference
- If Bart works with OC who has multiple cases with us, they often ask the same questions

## 5. Answering Interrogatories

1. Carefully review all interrogatory questions
2. Review **ALL documents** in the case file to find relevant information
3. Answer common/routine questions first with readily available information
4. For the client's personal information (name, address, etc.):

> **ANSWER:** [Client Name] C/O Denham Property and Injury Law Firm.

5. Identify questions where information is incomplete — clearly outline what's needed
6. Submit to Bart for review before serving

---

## 6. Answering Requests for Production of Documents (RFPD)

For requests we are **not objecting to**, use this standard response:

> Plaintiff is producing all documents responsive to this request within his possession, custody, or control.

For requests we **are objecting to**, state all objections with legal grounds and privilege assertions.

---

## 7. Serving Our Discovery Requests

When we serve discovery on the Defendant:
1. Prepare Interrogatories and RFPD
2. Get attorney approval
3. Serve on OC
4. Calendar **30 days** for their response deadline

---

## 8. Following Up on Defendant Responses

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 30 days from service | Check if defendant has responded |
| If no response | Send a letter of reminder |
| 30+ days late | File a **Motion to Compel** |

---

## 9. Deposition Procedures

1. Determine whether OC wants to depose our client
   - Schedule the deposition and prep the client
2. Determine whether it's worthwhile to depose the defendant
3. Ensure deposition costs are paid and added to case expenses
4. Save deposition transcripts to **Discovery — Depositions** folder

## 10. Formatting Standards

When formatting discovery responses:

- **Font:** Times New Roman, 12pt
- **Requests:** CAPITALIZED and **Bold**
- **Answers:** **Bold** and underlined
- **Spacing:**
  - Requests: 1.5 line spacing
  - Answers: 1.0 line spacing

**Example:**

> **INTERROGATORY NO. 1:** State your full name, any other name you have had or been known by, address, age, residence, business address, and occupation. *(1.5 spacing)*
>
> **<u>ANSWER:</u>** [Client Name] C/O Denham Property and Injury Law Firm. *(1.0 spacing)*

### Serving Discovery Answers

Once all questions are answered and reviewed by Bart:
1. Verify completeness and accuracy of ALL responses
2. Ensure all objections and privilege assertions are properly stated
3. Serve to OC

### Tips
- Insurance companies regularly ask the same questions — review "commonly asked questions" and Bart's preferred answers
- Review other cases from the same insurance company for reference examples
