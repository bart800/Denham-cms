## 1. Overview

Discovery is the litigation phase where both sides exchange information and documents. When the Defendant serves discovery on us, we have **30 days from the certificate of service date** to respond. When we serve discovery on the Defendant, they have the same obligation.

⚠️ **For RFAs:** If we don't answer within the time frame, all requests are **considered admitted by default.** This can be case-ending.

→ Discovery is often served WITH the complaint (→ see [SOP 04](04-complaints-and-filing.md)), in which case the defendant has **45 days** from Return of Service.

## 2. Types of Discovery

| Type | Abbreviation | Purpose | Deadline |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Request for Admissions | RFA | Defendant asks us to admit or deny specific statements | 30 days (⚠️ auto-admitted if missed) |
| Interrogatories | INT | Defendant asks specific questions about the case | 30 days |
| Request for Production of Documents | RFPD | Defendant requests specific documents | 30 days |

---

## 3. Receiving Discovery — Immediate Steps

When discovery is received:

1. **Calendar the deadline IMMEDIATELY:** 30 days from the date on the certificate of service (→ see [SOP 09](09-calendaring-and-deadlines.md))
   - Add a **reminder 10 days before** the deadline, sent to Bart
2. **Request a Word document** from Opposing Counsel (OC) if discovery was not received in an editable format
3. **Send discovery to the client** via email:

> Hi [Client Name],
>
> We received a set of discovery requests from the opposing party in your case. Discovery is a formal process where each side asks the other for information and documents. I've attached a copy for your review.
>
> We need your help answering some of these questions. Please review and get back to us with your responses within **7 days** so we have time to prepare and submit the answers before the deadline.
>
> I'll call you shortly to go over this in more detail.

4. **Call the client** to explain and provide clarification on what information is needed
   - Guide them on how to locate and provide requested documents
   - Document all communications in the CMS Activity section
5. **Standardize document formatting** while waiting for client responses (see [Section 10](#10-formatting-standards))
6. **Begin answering** routine/common questions with information available in the case file

## 4. Answering Requests for Admissions (RFAs)

### General Strategy

⚠️ **Try to deny everything**, except when you absolutely must admit.

### Common RFA Questions (Insurance Property Cases)

Our firm's discovery template includes 8 RFAs. Here are the most common ones insurance companies ask US, with typical responses:

**Typical RFA from Defendant:**
> REQUEST NO. 1: Please admit or deny that the amount in controversy for the claims of the Plaintiffs for breach of contract as alleged in Count I of the Complaint does not exceed $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

**Why they ask this:** They're trying to establish that the amount is under $75K to potentially remove the case to federal court or limit damages. Answer depends on the case — if our demand exceeds $75K, **deny**.

**Typical RFA from Defendant:**
> REQUEST NO. 3: Admit or deny that Defendants did not cause any termite damage to your residence.

**How to object and deny:**
> **ANSWER:** Objection, impermissible compound question and calls for legal conclusion that there was termite damage to the Property. Denied.

### Standard Objection Templates

**Compound question:**
> Objection, impermissible compound question that calls for multiple admissions or denials in a single request.

**Calls for legal conclusion:**
> Objection, this request calls for a legal conclusion.

**Vague/ambiguous:**
> Objection, this request is vague and ambiguous as to the meaning of "[term]."

### Tips
- Review other RFA answers from similar cases in the firm's files
- If Bart works with OC who has multiple cases with us, they often ask the same questions — check prior responses
- Admitted = admitted for the case. Never admit anything casually.

## 5. Answering Interrogatories

**⏱️ Expected Time: 1–2 hours (after client provides answers)**

### Our Discovery Template's Standard Interrogatories

When WE send interrogatories to the Defendant, here's what we ask (from the actual template):

> **INTERROGATORY NO. 1:** Please identify the individual(s) responding to these Interrogatories and those individuals' full names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and their relationship to this litigation.
>
> **INTERROGATORY NO. 5:** Describe in detail each and every investigative step conducted by you with respect to the facts and circumstances surrounding the subject loss.
>
> **INTERROGATORY NO. 6:** Identify all adjusters, claims representatives, supervisors, independent adjusters, or any other person associated with or retained by Defendant who had any involvement whatsoever with Plaintiff's Claim.
>
> **INTERROGATORY NO. 7:** State the amount of damage you contend Plaintiff suffered as a result of loss to which this litigation relates.
>
> **INTERROGATORY NO. 10:** If any of your responses to the Request For Admissions above were anything but an unqualified admission, please provide the complete factual basis for the denial or objection.

### Answering THEIR Interrogatories

1. Carefully review all interrogatory questions
2. Review **ALL documents** in the case file to find relevant information
3. Answer common/routine questions first with readily available information
4. For the client's personal information (name, address, etc.):

> **ANSWER:** [Client Name] C/O Denham Property and Injury Law Firm.

5. Identify questions where information is incomplete — clearly outline what's needed
6. Submit to Bart for review before serving

---

## 6. Answering Requests for Production of Documents (RFPD)

### Our Template's Standard Requests

When WE send RFPDs, we request 16 categories of documents including:

> **REQUEST NO. 3:** Please produce a certified copy of the Policy.
>
> **REQUEST NO. 5:** Please produce all communications between you and Plaintiff relating to the Claim.
>
> **REQUEST NO. 6:** Please produce all photographs of the Property relating to the Claim, including any thermal imagery. With respect to this request, please also include the original JPEG or TIFF digital files, or digital image files converted directly from the native digital format, including all metadata.
>
> **REQUEST NO. 11:** Please produce all documents related to your decision not to fully compensate or otherwise indemnify Plaintiff for the Claim.
>
> **REQUEST NO. 16:** Please produce the underwriting file for the Policy.

### Responding to THEIR Requests

For requests we are **not objecting to**, use this standard response:

> Plaintiff is producing all documents responsive to this request within his possession, custody, or control.

For requests we **are objecting to**, state all objections with legal grounds and privilege assertions.

### Common Objections

**Attorney-client privilege:**
> Objection. This request seeks documents protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine.

**Overly broad:**
> Objection. This request is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

**Already produced:**
> Without waiving objections, Plaintiff states that responsive documents have already been produced or are available in the claim file previously exchanged.

## 7. Our Discovery Requests — What We Send

When we serve discovery on the Defendant (usually filed WITH the complaint):

### What's Included (from our template)

| Section | Count | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Definitions & Instructions | 13 items | Define terms like "Insurance Company," "Property," "Claim," "document" |
| Requests for Admission | 8 RFAs | Establish basic facts (valid policy, timely notice, compliance) |
| Interrogatories | 10 INTs | Identify adjusters, investigation steps, damage estimates, experts |
| Requests for Production | 16 RFPDs | Policy, communications, photos, estimates, underwriting file |

### Key Definitions from Our Template

Our template includes detailed definitions (these are important to review):

> "Insurance Company" means Defendant, including all past and present affiliates, subsidiaries, and parents, and all respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, attorneys, and any other person acting or purporting to act on its behalf.
>
> "Property" shall mean Plaintiff's property at [address].
>
> "Claim" means claim number [#] for the loss to the Property.

### Process
1. Prepare Interrogatories and RFPD from template
2. Get attorney approval
3. File with the complaint or serve on OC
4. Calendar **30 days** (or **45 days** if served with complaint) for their response deadline

---

## 8. Following Up on Defendant Responses

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 30/45 days from service | Check if defendant has responded |
| If no response | Send a letter of reminder |
| 30+ days late | File a **Motion to Compel** (→ discuss with Bart) |

---

## 9. Deposition Procedures

1. Determine whether OC wants to depose our client
   - Schedule the deposition and prep the client
   - Bart preps the client on what to expect, what NOT to volunteer
2. Determine whether it's worthwhile to depose the defendant's adjuster or representative
3. Ensure deposition costs are paid and added to case expenses (→ log in CMS Expenses)
4. Save deposition transcripts to **Discovery — Depositions** folder

→ See also: [SOP 08 — PI Case Lifecycle](08-pi-case-lifecycle.md) for PI-specific deposition procedures

---

## 10. Formatting Standards

When formatting discovery responses:

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| **Font** | Times New Roman, 12pt |
| **Requests** | CAPITALIZED and **Bold** |
| **Answers** | **Bold** and underlined |
| **Request spacing** | 1.5 line spacing |
| **Answer spacing** | 1.0 line spacing |

### Example

> **INTERROGATORY NO. 1:** STATE YOUR FULL NAME, ANY OTHER NAME YOU HAVE HAD OR BEEN KNOWN BY, ADDRESS, AGE, RESIDENCE, BUSINESS ADDRESS, AND OCCUPATION. *(1.5 spacing)*
>
> **<u>ANSWER:</u>** George D. Bonilla, C/O Denham Property and Injury Law Firm. *(1.0 spacing)*

### Certificate of Service

Every discovery response ends with a Certificate of Service:

```
CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

I hereby certify that on [date], a true and accurate copy of the
foregoing document was served via email upon:

[OC Name]
[OC Email]
[OC Firm Address]

COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT

/s/ J. Bart Denham
COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF
```

## 11. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Missing the RFA deadline** — If you miss it, everything is deemed admitted. This can literally lose the case.
2. **Forgetting to calendar the 10-day reminder** — The 30-day deadline sneaks up. Calendar the reminder too.
3. **Not requesting Word format from OC** — If they send a PDF, ask for Word. You'll waste hours reformatting otherwise.
4. **Admitting something you shouldn't have** — When in doubt, DENY and object. Never admit casually.
5. **Not sending discovery to the client first** — The client needs time to review and provide answers. Send immediately.
6. **Inconsistent objections** — If you object to one request on privilege grounds, make sure you're consistent across similar requests.
7. **Forgetting the verification page** — Interrogatory answers must be verified under oath. The verification page must be signed.

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Insurance companies ask the same questions** — Once you've answered discovery for one Allstate case, the next one is 80% the same. Keep copies of approved answers as reference.
2. **Request No. 10 in our interrogatories is a trap for defendants** — It requires them to explain every RFA they didn't fully admit. If their RFA answers are sloppy, this exposes it.
3. **Request No. 16 (underwriting file) is gold** — The underwriting file shows what the insurer knew about the property before the loss. It sometimes contains inspection photos or notes that help our case.
4. **For RFPD responses, produce in organized folders** — Don't dump 200 pages in one PDF. Organize by request number. Makes you look professional and makes Bart's life easier.
5. **Start on day 1** — Don't wait until day 20 to start working on discovery answers. The client needs time, you need time, Bart needs time to review.
