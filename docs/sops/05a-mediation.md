## 1. Overview

Mediation is a facilitated negotiation session where a neutral third party (the mediator) helps both sides reach a settlement. Unlike a trial, the mediator does NOT decide the case — they help the parties find middle ground.

Mediation is **not binding** unless the parties agree to a settlement. If no agreement is reached, the case continues to trial.

For property insurance cases, mediation typically occurs after discovery is complete. For PI cases, it may be required by the court's trial order.

---

## 2. When Mediation Happens

```
Demand sent and rejected/ignored
    → Complaint filed (SOP 04)
        → Discovery exchanged (SOP 05)
            → Discovery complete
                ├── Parties agree to mediate → MEDIATION
                ├── Court orders mediation → MEDIATION (mandatory)
                └── Parties refuse → Move for trial date
```

### Triggers for Mediation
- **Voluntary:** Both sides agree mediation is worth trying
- **Court-ordered:** Many trial orders include a mediation requirement before trial
- **Strategic:** Bart may recommend mediation if the case has strong facts but litigation costs are mounting

### Alternative: Appraisal
For property insurance cases, appraisal may be a better option than mediation — see [SOP 05b — Appraisal](05b-appraisal.md).

## 3. Scheduling Mediation

**⏱️ Expected Time: 30 minutes**

### Step 1: Contact Opposing Counsel
> [OC Name],
>
> I'd like to discuss scheduling mediation in [Client Name] v. [Insurance Company]. Do you have availability in the next 4-6 weeks? I have a few mediator suggestions — happy to discuss.
>
> Please let me know your client's position on mediation and any scheduling constraints.

### Step 2: Agree on a Mediator
→ See [Section 4](#4-mediator-selection)

### Step 3: Schedule the Session
- Contact the mediator's office to book
- Confirm date, time, location (or Zoom link)
- Most mediations are half-day (4 hours) or full-day (8 hours)

### Step 4: Calendar It
- **Title:** `Mediation - [Client Last Name]`
- **Invite:** Bart, paralegal, client
- **Description:** Include mediator name, location/Zoom link, OC contact info
- Calendar a **prep meeting** with Bart 1 week before

### Step 5: Confirm with Client
- Call the client to explain what mediation is
- Confirm they are available and understand what to expect
- Explain that they need to be present (in person or by phone)

## 4. Mediator Selection

### Factors to Consider
| Factor | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Location** | Prefer mediators in or near the county where the case is filed |
| **Experience** | Insurance property cases require specific expertise |
| **Cost** | Typically $200-$500/hour, split between parties |
| **Availability** | Must work for both sides' schedules |
| **Track record** | Ask Bart — he knows which mediators are effective |

### Process
1. Bart suggests 2-3 mediator names
2. Send names to OC for agreement
3. If OC objects to all, ask for their suggestions
4. If parties can't agree, the court may appoint one

---

## 5. Mediation Statement Preparation

**⏱️ Expected Time: 3–5 hours**

The mediation statement is sent to the mediator (and sometimes OC) before the mediation session. It's essentially a condensed version of our case.

### Contents of the Mediation Statement

1. **Case Summary** — Brief facts: who, what, when, where
2. **Liability Analysis** — Why the carrier owes
3. **Damages Summary** — Itemized with supporting documents
4. **Settlement History** — Prior offers, demands, and responses
5. **Legal Authority** — Key statutes and case law
6. **Settlement Position** — What we're willing to accept (sometimes kept confidential from OC)

### Structure

```
MEDIATION STATEMENT
[Case Name] v. [Defendant]
[County] Circuit Court, Case No. [X]
Mediator: [Name]
Date: [Mediation Date]

I. INTRODUCTION
   [Brief overview — 1 paragraph]

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
    [Loss details, claim history, carrier response]

III. DAMAGES
     [Itemized breakdown with supporting documents]

     Contractor Estimate          $XX,XXX.XX
     ALE                          $ X,XXX.XX
     Prior Payments              ($X,XXX.XX)
     Deductible                  ($X,XXX.XX)

     Attorneys' Fees              TBD
                                  ----------
     Total Claim                 $XX,XXX.XX

IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS
    [KRS 304.12-230, breach of contract, bad faith arguments]

V. SETTLEMENT HISTORY
   [Timeline of offers/demands]

VI. CONCLUSION
    [Our position and willingness to negotiate]
```

### Deadline
- Send to mediator at least **5 business days** before the session
- Send to OC at the same time (unless Bart directs otherwise)

## 6. In-House Prep Materials

Prepare these for Bart BEFORE the mediation (not shared with the other side):

### Settlement Authority Worksheet

| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Best case** (full demand) | $XX,XXX | What we'd get at trial |
| **Target** | $XX,XXX | Realistic settlement |
| **Floor** (minimum acceptable) | $XX,XXX | Below this = no deal |
| **BATNA** (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement) | — | What happens if we don't settle? |

### Case Expenses to Date

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Filing fee | $300 |
| Service fees | $XX |
| Expert reports | $XXX |
| Deposition costs | $XXX |
| Mediator deposit | $XXX |
| **Total** | $X,XXX |

### Updated Lien Information (PI cases)
- Contact all lienholders for updated balances (→ see [SOP 08](08-pi-case-lifecycle.md))
- Confirm PIP balance remaining
- Document all liens at face value

## 7. Mediation Day

### What to Expect

1. **Opening session** — Both sides present their case to the mediator (15-30 min each)
2. **Caucus sessions** — Mediator goes back and forth between rooms/calls
3. **Negotiations** — Offers and counteroffers through the mediator
4. **Resolution** — Either agreement or impasse

### Client Prep

Explain to the client:
- They should be **available the entire day** (even if told half-day)
- They may need to speak briefly in the opening session
- The mediator is NOT the judge — they're a facilitator
- The other side will say negative things about our case — that's normal
- **Do not agree to anything** without Bart's approval
- Patience is key — mediations often take hours

## 8. If the Case Settles at Mediation

1. **Sign the settlement agreement** at mediation (or agree to terms and memorialize later)
2. Confirm settlement amount and payment terms
3. → Proceed to [SOP 06 — Settlement & Distribution](06-settlement-and-distribution.md)
4. Update CMS phase to "Settled"
5. Notify the client of the outcome and next steps

---

## 9. If the Case Does NOT Settle

1. Notify the client that mediation was unsuccessful
2. Discuss next steps with Bart:
   - **Continue negotiating** informally
   - **Request a trial date** from the court
   - **Consider appraisal** as an alternative (→ [SOP 05b](05b-appraisal.md))
3. Calendar any trial-related deadlines from the court's trial order
4. Resume litigation activities

⚠️ **Calendar ALL deadlines from the trial order** — exhibit lists, witness lists, motions in limine, pretrial conference, trial date. Missing any of these = sanctions.

---

## 10. Costs & Payment

| Item | Typical Cost | Who Pays |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Mediator fee | $200-500/hour | Split 50/50 between parties |
| Deposit | $500-1,500 | Our share paid upfront |
| Room rental | Varies | Usually included in mediator fee |

### Process
1. Pay mediator deposit when scheduling
2. Log as case expense in CMS
3. Sign mediator's engagement agreement if required
4. After mediation, pay balance of mediator fee
5. Mediator costs are included in case expenses at settlement distribution

## 11. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Not prepping the client** — Clients who don't understand mediation get frustrated, emotional, or make bad decisions.
2. **Missing the mediation deadline in a trial order** — Some trial orders require mediation by a specific date. Calendar it.
3. **Sending the mediation statement late** — Mediators need time to prepare. Late statements = less effective mediator.
4. **Not updating lien amounts before mediation** — Stale lien information leads to inaccurate settlement calculations.
5. **Not having settlement authority from the client** — Bart needs to know the client's floor number BEFORE mediation, not during.

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **The first offer is never the final offer** — Mediation is a negotiation. Start high, expect counteroffers, be patient.
2. **Bring extra copies of key exhibits** — The mediator may want to show specific documents to the other side.
3. **Schedule prep meeting with Bart 1 week before** — Don't wait until the day before.
4. **Keep the client calm** — Mediations are emotional. Your job is to keep the client focused on the numbers, not the feelings.
5. **Document the settlement terms precisely** — If you settle, get the terms in writing BEFORE leaving the mediation. "We agreed to $X" without specifics leads to disputes.
