## 1. Overview

**Purpose:** To establish consistent procedures for requesting, tracking, and receiving medical records on behalf of clients, in compliance with HIPAA, KRS 422.317, KRS 304.17A-555, and federal regulations.

Securing the client's medical records in a timely manner means demands can be sent out as soon as possible. Delays in obtaining records = delays in the entire case.

**Key Statute:** KRS 422.317 entitles the patient to their **first free copy** of medical records in Kentucky. Always cite this statute in KY requests.

→ See [SOP 08 — PI Case Lifecycle](08-pi-case-lifecycle.md) for how medical records fit into the overall PI case flow.

---

## 2. Step 1 — Obtain Signed Authorization

**⏱️ Expected Time: Part of intake — should already be done**

- Obtain a **HIPAA-compliant medical authorization** signed and dated by the client (or legal representative)
- Ensure authorization contains:
  - ✅ Patient's Full Name
  - ✅ Address
  - ✅ Date of Birth
  - ✅ Social Security Number
  - ✅ Signature
  - ✅ Date

⚠️ **Do not send a records request without a signed authorization.** Providers will reject it and you'll lose 2+ weeks.

→ See [SOP 01 — Intake & Signup](01-intake-and-signup.md) — medical authorizations should be obtained at intake.

---

## 3. Step 2 — Identify Records Custodian

**⏱️ Expected Time: 5–10 minutes per provider**

- Confirm the correct facility, provider, or records department by calling and/or reviewing their website
- Note the provider's **preferred submission method** (fax, mail, email, portal)

💡 **Tip:** Check the **Master Medical Provider List** first to locate provider information. If this is a new provider, **add their information to the list** (see [Section 13](#13-provider-list-management)).

---

## 4. Step 3 — Add Provider to CMS

1. Navigate to the client's **Medicals** section in the CMS
2. Click **+ Add an Item**
3. Search for the provider
   - If no contact card exists, **create a new one**
4. Select **Provider Type** (hospital, chiropractor, PCP, specialist, etc.)
5. Select **Treatment Status** (active, completed, unknown)
6. Add any treatment notes if necessary:
   - Example: "Treated here on DOL," "subsequent provider," "referred by Dr. Smith"

---

## 5. Step 4 — Prepare Request Package

**⏱️ Expected Time: 15–20 minutes per provider**

The request package includes:

1. ✅ **Medical records request letter** (see [Section 11](#11-medical-records-request-letter-template-ky))
2. ✅ **Signed HIPAA Authorization** (attached)
3. ✅ **Certification Page** (see [Section 12](#12-certification-of-medical-records-template))

### What to Request

Request **all** of the following:
- Medical records (charts, notes, orders)
- Billing records (itemized)
- Radiology records and images
- Lab results
- Emergency room records / run reports / ambulance records
- Nursing notes
- Physician notes and orders

### Date Range

- **Start date:** Date of the accident/injury (or earlier if prior treatment is relevant)
- **End date:** "to Present"

---

## 6. Step 5 — Submit Request

Send request via the provider's preferred method:

| Method | When to Use | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Fax** (preferred) | Most providers accept fax | Keep confirmation page |
| **Mail** | If no fax available | Send certified if large request |
| **Email** | If provider accepts email | Confirm HIPAA-compliant transmission |
| **Portal** | Some large health systems | May require separate registration |
| **Third-party processor** | For difficult providers | e.g., Chartswap |

**CC the billing and radiology departments** separately if the provider has separate fax numbers for those departments.

---

## 7. Step 6 — Set Reminders & Tasks

- Under **Reminders** in the CMS: Add a deadline that records are due in **30 days** from date of request
- Under the project's **Activity** section: Create a task to follow up with the records custodian in **14 days**
- Bump the follow-up task out appropriately until records are received

→ See [SOP 09 — Calendaring & Deadlines](09-calendaring-and-deadlines.md) for calendar entry procedures.

---

## 8. Step 7 — Follow-Up Timeline

| Timeframe from Request | Action | Method |
|----------------------|--------|--------|
| **Day 0** | Send request package | Fax/mail/email |
| **Day 14** | First follow-up — confirm receipt, ask for status | Phone call + fax |
| **Day 28** | Second follow-up — records are almost due | Phone call + fax |
| **Day 30** | Records due — demand completion | Phone call |
| **Day 35** | Third follow-up — if not received | Phone call + escalation email |
| **Day 45+** | Escalate — consider alternative methods | Attorney letter or third-party service |

### Follow-Up Call Script

> "Hi, this is [your name] from Denham Property and Injury Law Firm. I'm calling to follow up on a medical records request we sent on [date] for patient [patient name], date of birth [DOB]. Can you confirm you received our request and provide an estimated completion date?"

### Document Every Follow-Up

⚠️ **Log every call** in the project's Activity section in CMS. Include:
- Date and time of call
- Who you spoke with
- What they said (estimated completion date, issues, etc.)

This information is essential for:
- Client updates (→ see [SOP 07](07-client-communication.md))
- Demonstrating diligence if records are subpoenaed
- Escalation decisions

---

## 9. Step 8 — Receipt & Processing of Records

**⏱️ Expected Time: 15–30 minutes per provider (review and filing)**

When records arrive:

### 9.1 Save to CMS

- Upload records to the **Medicals** section in CMS under the appropriate provider field
- Separate medical records from billing records

### 9.2 Save to OneDrive Backup

- File in OneDrive backup under: **Medical Records → [Provider Name]**
- Create subfolders:
  - `Med Rec` — treatment records
  - `Billing` — billing records
  - `Radiology` — imaging records/reports

### 9.3 Review Records

When records are received, perform an initial review:

| Check | What to Look For |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Completeness** | Do records cover the full date range requested? |
| **Correct patient** | Verify name and DOB match our client |
| **All record types** | Did we receive medical records AND billing AND radiology? |
| **Legibility** | Can the records be read? If not, request better copies |
| **Certification** | Is the certification page completed and notarized? |
| **Relevant findings** | Any diagnoses, treatment notes, or referrals relevant to the case? |

### 9.4 Summarize Key Findings

Create a brief summary note in CMS Activity:
- Dates of treatment
- Key diagnoses
- Total billed amount
- Any referrals to other providers (may need to request those records too)
- Any pre-existing conditions noted

### 9.5 Notify the Team

- Update the treatment status in CMS
- If records reveal new providers → initiate new records requests
- If records are complete for this provider → mark as "Records Received" in CMS

---

## 10. Step 9 — Determine if Updates Needed

If the client is still treating or has seen additional providers:

- Under **Reminders**, create a deadline to obtain updated records
- Repeat the request process for new/updated records
- **Check in monthly** with the client about treatment status

→ See [SOP 08 — PI Case Lifecycle, Section 7](08-pi-case-lifecycle.md#7-treatment-status-tracking) for treatment tracking procedures.

## 12. Certification of Medical Records Template

Include this certification page with every records request:

> **CERTIFICATION OF MEDICAL RECORDS**
>
> **Medical Provider Information:**  
> Provider Name: ____________________  
> Provider Address: ____________________  
>
> **Patient's Information:**  
> Name: ____________________  
> Address: ____________________  
> DOB: ____________________  
> SSN: ____________________  
>
> **Page Count:** _______
>
> I, __________________, Custodian of Medical Records, for _______________________, hereby certify that the foregoing records are kept on behalf of our company in the regular course of business. Further, that the attached records are originals or true and correct copies of the original records.
>

>
> Sworn and subscribed before me on the ___ day of ______, 20___.
>
> My Commission Expires: ____________________
>
> __________________________________________  
> Notary Public, State of _____________

### Why We Need Certification

- Certified records can be admitted as evidence without the custodian testifying
- Required under business records exception to hearsay rules
- Important for litigation — uncertified records may be challenged

## 13. Provider List Management

### Master Medical Provider List

Maintain a centralized list of all medical providers the firm has interacted with. This saves time on future requests.

**The list should include:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Provider Name | Ollis Chiropractic |
| Address | 123 Main St, Louisville, KY 40202 |
| Phone | (502) 555-1234 |
| Fax (Medical Records) | (502) 555-1235 |
| Fax (Billing) | (502) 555-1236 |
| Fax (Radiology) | (502) 555-1237 |
| Email | records@ollischiro.com |
| Preferred Method | Fax |
| Notes | Responds quickly; 2-week turnaround |
| Portal URL | N/A |

### Maintaining the List

- **Before sending a new request:** Check the list first
- **After contacting a new provider:** Add them to the list immediately
- **Update notes** when you learn about turnaround times, preferred methods, or contact changes
- **Flag difficult providers** — note if they're slow, unresponsive, or require special procedures

---

## 14. Cost Tracking for Records Requests

### When Do We Pay?

- **First request in KY:** Free under KRS 422.317
- **Subsequent requests (same provider, same patient):** Provider may charge
- **Non-KY states:** Provider may charge for any request
- **Any invoice over $300:** Requires prior approval before paying

### Cost Tracking Procedure

1. When an invoice arrives, log it in the CMS under **Expenses**
2. Include: provider name, amount, date, client name
3. If over $300 → escalate to attorney for approval
4. Pay approved invoices promptly — delays in payment can delay records
5. All records costs are deducted from the client's settlement at distribution

### Typical Costs

| Item | Typical Cost |
|------|-------------|
| First free copy (KY) | $0 |
| Per-page copy fee | $0.25–$1.00 |
| Radiology images (disc) | $10–$50 |
| Retrieval/handling fee | $10–$25 |
| Certification fee | $5–$15 |
| Rush processing | $25–$100+ |

→ See [SOP 06 — Settlement & Distribution](06-settlement-and-distribution.md) for how records costs are included in the distribution calculation.

## 15. HIPAA Authorization Procedures

### What Is a Valid HIPAA Authorization?

Under 45 CFR § 164.508, a valid authorization must include:

| Required Element | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|
| Description of information to be disclosed | "All medical records, billing records, and radiology records" |
| Name of person/entity authorized to make disclosure | The provider |
| Name of person/entity authorized to receive info | Denham Property and Injury Law Firm |
| Description of purpose | "Legal representation" |
| Expiration date or event | Include a reasonable date or "upon completion of legal matter" |
| Patient signature and date | Must be original (wet signature or electronic) |
| Right to revoke | Standard language about right to revoke authorization |

### Common HIPAA Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Authorization expired | Get new authorization signed by client |
| Authorization doesn't name specific provider | Use a general authorization that covers all providers |
| Provider says authorization is insufficient | Ask what specifically is missing; update and resend |
| Client is a minor | Parent/guardian must sign |
| Client is incapacitated | Legal representative must sign with documentation |

## 16. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Sending request without signed authorization** | Provider rejects it; lose 2+ weeks | Verify authorization is signed before preparing any request |
| **Wrong date range** | Missing treatment records; demand is incomplete | Always use DOL to Present |
| **Forgetting to CC billing/radiology** | Only get treatment records, not bills or images | CC separate departments on every request |
| **Not following up at 14 days** | Records slip through the cracks | Set CMS task for 14-day follow-up on every request |
| **Not documenting follow-up calls** | No proof of diligence; team can't see status | Log every call in CMS Activity section |
| **Not checking Master Provider List** | Wasting time looking up info that's already documented | Check list first, always |
| **Not adding new providers to the list** | Next person has to look up the same info | Add to list immediately after first contact |
| **Paying invoices over $300 without approval** | Unauthorized expense | Flag any invoice over $300 for attorney approval |
| **Not verifying records match the right patient** | Wrong patient's records in the file — major HIPAA issue | Always verify name and DOB when records arrive |
| **Filing records in wrong location** | Team can't find them; records appear missing | Follow the exact folder structure (CMS + OneDrive) |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Send all requests on the same day** — batch your work for all providers at once
- **Fax is king** — faster and more reliable than mail; keep fax confirmations
- **Call before you fax** — a quick call to confirm the fax number and records department contact saves resend hassles
- **Request records electronically** — digital records are easier to search and share
- **Build relationships with records departments** — being polite and professional gets records faster
- **Track turnaround times** by provider — helps set realistic expectations for clients and attorneys
- **For large health systems** (UK Healthcare, Norton, etc.) — expect 3–4 weeks minimum
- **For small practices** — records may come faster but billing may be separate
- **When a provider is unresponsive after 45 days:** Consider Chartswap or attorney escalation letter
- **Always request radiology images on disc** — they may be needed for expert review
- **Keep a running list** of pending records requests with dates — review weekly
- **Pre-fill the request letter template** for each provider — saves time on repeat requests
