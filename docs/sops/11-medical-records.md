## 1. Overview

**Purpose:** To establish consistent procedures for requesting, tracking, and receiving medical records on behalf of clients, in compliance with HIPAA, KRS 422.317, KRS 304.17A-555, and federal regulations.

Securing the client's medical records in a timely manner means demands can be sent out as soon as possible.

---

## 2. Step 1 — Obtain Signed Authorization

- Obtain a **HIPAA-compliant medical authorization** signed and dated by the client (or legal representative)
- Ensure authorization contains:
  - ✅ Patient's Full Name
  - ✅ Address
  - ✅ Date of Birth
  - ✅ Social Security Number
  - ✅ Signature
  - ✅ Date

---

## 3. Step 2 — Identify Records Custodian

- Confirm the correct facility, provider, or records department by calling and/or reviewing their website
- Note the provider's **preferred submission method** (fax, mail, email, portal)

💡 **Tip:** Check the **Master Medical Provider List** first to locate provider information. If this is a new provider, **add their information to the list**.

---

## 4. Step 3 — Add Provider to CMS

1. Navigate to the client's Medicals section in the CMS
2. Click **+ Add an Item**
3. Search for the provider
   - If no contact card exists, create a new one
4. Select **Provider Type**
5. Select **Treatment Status**
6. Add any treatment notes if necessary (e.g., "Treated here on DOL," "subsequent provider," etc.)

---

## 5. Step 4 — Prepare Request Package

The request package includes:

1. ✅ **Medical records request letter** (see template below)
2. ✅ **Signed HIPAA Authorization** (attached)
3. ✅ **Certification Page** (attached)

---

## 6. Step 5 — Submit Request

Send request via the provider's preferred method:
- **Fax** (preferred)
- Mail
- Email
- Third-party records processor (e.g., Chartswap)

---

## 7. Step 6 — Set Reminders & Tasks

- Under **Reminders** in the CMS: Add a deadline that records are due in **30 days** from date of request
- Under the project's **Activity** section: Create a task to follow up with the records custodian in **14 days**
- Bump the follow-up task out appropriately until records are received

---

## 8. Step 7 — Follow Up

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **14 days** | Follow up to ensure facility received the request and is working on it |
| **30 days** (total from request date) | Follow up again — records are now due |
| **Ongoing** | Continue following up until records are received |

**Best practice:** Follow up via **telephone call AND fax**.

⚠️ **Document all calls** in the project's Activity section so everyone can see your efforts and use this information to provide client updates.

---

## 9. Step 8 — Receipt of Records

- Upload records to the **Medicals** section in the CMS under the appropriate provider field
- File in OneDrive backup under: **Medical Records → [Provider Name] → Med Rec / Billing subfolders**

---

## 10. Step 9 — Determine if Updates Needed

If the client is still treating or has seen additional providers:
- Under **Reminders**, create a deadline to obtain updated records
- Repeat the request process for new/updated records
