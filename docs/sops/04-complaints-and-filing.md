## 1. Overview

The Complaint is the document we file to proceed with litigation. Once filed, the case is in litigation. Insurance complaints use the firm's complaint template. Construction defect complaints do NOT have a separate template.

⚠️ The attorney must review the final Word version before filing. Allow **at least 48 hours** for review. Be mindful of out-of-office time and weekends.

---

## 2. Pre-Filing Preparation

Before drafting:
1. ✅ Prepare the Complaint — allow attorney review of final Word version
2. ✅ Prepare initial set of Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents — allow attorney review
3. ✅ Save both as PDF once approved (cannot file in Word format)
4. ✅ Have firm credit card info available (request by 4:30 PM the day of filing if needed from management)

---

## 3. Defendant Name Verification

⚠️ **You must include the FULL legal name of the insurance company.**

- "State Farm" is NOT the full name — it's "State Farm Fire and Casualty Company"
- Find the name on the policy or insurance correspondence
- **Verify** on the state's Department of Insurance website

### How to Verify (Kentucky Example)
1. Go to the Kentucky Department of Insurance website
2. Click **"Insurers"** → **"Insurer Search"**
3. Search by company name
4. Confirm the exact legal name

---

## 4. Registered Agent Lookup

From the Department of Insurance search results:
1. Click the insurer name
2. Find the **Process Agent Name** and **Address**
3. List the Registered Agent Name and Address together in the complaint

4. Save a copy to the **Pleadings** folder

### 5.3 Section-by-Section Review

#### Home vs. Foreign Corporation
