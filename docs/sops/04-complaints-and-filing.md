## 1. Overview

The Complaint is the document we file to proceed with litigation. Once filed, the case is in litigation. Insurance complaints use the firm's complaint template. Construction defect complaints do NOT have a separate template.

⚠️ The attorney must review the final Word version before filing. Allow **at least 48 hours** for review. Be mindful of out-of-office time and weekends.

---

## 2. Pre-Filing Preparation

Before drafting:
1. ✅ Prepare the Complaint — allow attorney review of final Word version
2. ✅ Prepare initial set of Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents (→ see [SOP 05](05-discovery.md)) — allow attorney review
3. ✅ Save both as PDF once approved (cannot file in Word format)
4. ✅ Have firm credit card info available (request by 4:30 PM the day of filing if needed from management)

---

## 3. Defendant Name Verification

⚠️ **You must include the FULL legal name of the insurance company.**

| Wrong ❌ | Right ✅ |
|----------|---------|
| State Farm | State Farm Fire and Casualty Company |
| Allstate | Allstate Indemnity Company |
| Progressive | Progressive Home Insurance Company |
| USAA | USAA Casualty Insurance Company |

- Find the name on the policy or insurance correspondence
- **Verify** on the state's Department of Insurance website

### How to Verify (Kentucky Example)
1. Go to the Kentucky Department of Insurance website
2. Click **"Insurers"** → **"Insurer Search"**
3. Search by company name
4. Confirm the exact legal name

---

## 4. Registered Agent Lookup

From the Department of Insurance search results:
1. Click the insurer name
2. Find the **Process Agent Name** and **Address**
3. List the Registered Agent Name and Address together in the complaint

---

## 5. Complaint Template Selection

```
How many plaintiffs?       How many defendants?
│                          │
├── 1 Plaintiff            ├── 1 Defendant (standard)
│   → "Complaint template  │   → Standard template
│      1 plaintiff,        │
│      1 defendant"        ├── Multiple Defendants
│                          │   → Ask Bart — may need
├── 2 Plaintiffs           │     custom additions
│   ├── With policy info   │
│   │   → "Complaint       └── Construction Defect
│   │      template 2          → No template; draft
│   │      plaintiff,            from scratch with Bart
│   │      no policy,
│   │      1 defendant"
│   └── Standard
│       → "Complaint
│          template 2
│          plaintiff"
│
└── 3+ Plaintiffs
    → Customize from 2-plaintiff template
      (add additional plaintiff sections)
```

⚠️ **Anyone named on the policy MUST be a plaintiff in the complaint.** If the policy lists John and Jane Smith, both must be plaintiffs — even if only John signed the ATR (go back and get Jane's signature too).

## 6. Drafting the Complaint

### 6.1 Add Custom Fields in CMS

Enter all required fields so they auto-populate into the template:

- ✅ Claim Number
- ✅ County (search the loss address — county shown in results)
- ✅ Date of Loss
- ✅ Defendant FULL NAME (from policy → verify with Dept. of Insurance)
- ✅ Defendant Mailing Address (from LOR)
- ✅ Defendant City, State, Zip
- ✅ Location of Loss
- ✅ Policy Number
- ✅ Registered Agent Mailing Address (from Dept. of Insurance)

### 6.2 Generate from Template

1. Go to the client's Documents section in the CMS
2. Create document from template
3. Choose the correct template (→ see [Section 5](#5-complaint-template-selection))
4. Save a copy to the **Pleadings** folder

### 6.3 Section-by-Section Review

#### County
Where the loss occurred determines the county.

#### Division and Civil Action No.
Leave as-is — we don't receive these until the case is processed.

#### Plaintiff Name
Must match what appears on the Policy and Demand.

#### Defendant Name
Always the insurance company. Bart will instruct if additional defendants needed.

#### Home vs. Foreign Corporation

**At-home corporation** (headquartered in the state):
> At all times relevant and material hereto, [Insurance Company], was an at-home corporation, registered with the State of [State], and engaged in the business of providing insurance policies to property owners in [County] County, [State].

**Foreign corporation** (headquartered elsewhere):
> At all times relevant and material hereto, [Insurance Company], was a foreign corporation engaged in the business of providing insurance policies to property owners in [County] County, [State].

Check the insurance company's address on the Dept. of Insurance website.

#### Remaining Sections — Check:

| Section | Verify |
|---------|--------|
| **Introduction** | Plaintiff name, plurality ("Plaintiff" vs "Plaintiffs") |
| **Jurisdiction and Venue** | County name |
| **Parties** | Plaintiff name, address; Defendant name, home/foreign |
| **General Allegations** | County, Insurance name, Policy #, DOL (format: "July 2, 2024"), Claim #, denied/delayed/underpaid |
| **Count I — Breach of Contract** | Plurality; "failed to pay **any of**" vs. "failed to pay **the majority of**" |
| **Count II — Statutory Bad Faith** | Plurality throughout |
| **Count III — Common Law Bad Faith** | Plurality; "partially delaying" vs. "partially denying"; "to delay" vs. "to deny" |
| **Closing / Damages** | Client name and insurance company name |
| **Jury Demand** | ⚠️ **"For a trial of this cause by a jury" MUST be present — ALWAYS** |
| **Date and Signature** | Update the date |

### 6.4 Submit for Review
Send to Bart for review. Bring questions or uncertainties to his attention.

| Deadline | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|

### Statute of Limitations Reference (Property Insurance)

⚠️ **This is a general reference only — always check the specific policy's "Suit Against Us" provision.**

| State | General Contract SOL | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| KY | 5 years (10 years written contract) | Policy may shorten to 1-2 years |
| MT | 5 years (written) / 3 years (oral) | Policy provisions may shorten |
| IN | 6 years (written) / 10 years | — |
| TN | 6 years (written) | — |
| AZ | 6 years (written) | — |
| OH | 8 years (written) | — |
| TX | 4 years | — |
| FL | 5 years (written) | — |
| OR | 6 years (written) | — |

⚠️ **The policy's "Suit Against Us" clause typically overrides the general SOL** with a shorter period (often 1 or 2 years from DOL). Always check the policy.

## 13. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong defendant name** — "State Farm" instead of "State Farm Fire and Casualty Company." Verify on DOI website EVERY TIME.
2. **Entering plaintiff's address in the e-filing system** — Do NOT enter the plaintiff's address. Only enter name.
3. **Forgetting to check plurality** — If there are two plaintiffs, every "Plaintiff" must be "Plaintiffs" throughout the entire complaint.
4. **"Jury demand" missing** — Must ALWAYS be present. If it's missing, we've waived our right to a jury trial.
5. **Wrong county** — The county where the LOSS occurred, not where the client lives (unless they're the same).
6. **Filing without attorney review** — Never file without Bart's written approval. Allow 48 hours.
7. **Home vs. foreign corporation wrong** — Check DOI. If the company is headquartered in KY, it's "at-home." Otherwise, "foreign."
8. **Forgetting to serve discovery WITH the complaint** — We almost always serve interrogatories and RFPD at the same time as filing. If you forget, the 45-day discovery clock doesn't start.
9. **Not saving the NCP** — The Notice of Court Processing is proof of filing. Save it immediately.

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Prepare the complaint and discovery at the same time** — Bart reviews both together, and they're filed together.
2. **Request the credit card info the day BEFORE you plan to file** — Asking at 4:35 PM when you need to file = bad day.
3. **Double-check "delaying" vs. "denying"** in Count III — These words have different legal meanings. Use the correct one based on what the carrier actually did.
4. **Keep a screenshot of the e-filing confirmation page** — In case the email confirmation is delayed or lost.
5. **For multiple-defendant cases**, confirm with Bart which defendants need to be served via RAOS vs. certified mail.
