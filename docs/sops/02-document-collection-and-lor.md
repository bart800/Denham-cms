## 1. Overview

After a client signs the ATR (→ see [SOP 01](01-intake-and-signup.md)), there are two parallel tracks:
1. **Request documents from the client** — correspondence, estimates, photos, policy
2. **Send the Letter of Representation (LOR) to the insurance company** — this triggers the carrier to communicate through us and send their file

Both should happen as quickly as possible after signup.

---

## 2. Requesting Documents from the Client

### 2.1 Process

**⏱️ Expected Time: 10 minutes**

1. Intake specialist notifies the team that a new client has signed
2. Paralegal sends the following email:

> Good [morning/afternoon] [Client Name],
>
> Thank you for signing our Authority to Represent document. We look forward to working with you. At your earliest convenience, please send all documentation you have related to the claim. This includes correspondence with the insurance company, estimates, photos, reports, payments, your policy, etc. If you haven't already provided it, please include your claim and policy number as well.
>
> As a reminder, all future correspondence should go through our office. If the insurance company reaches out to you, please redirect them to our office; we can be reached at (859) 900-2278.
>
> Thank you again, please feel free to reach out with any updates, questions, or concerns.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Signature]

3. Upload documents to the corresponding CMS folders as they are received
4. Notify the team of new uploads

---

## 3. Letter of Representation (LOR)

⚠️ **Send the LOR ASAP after signing up the client.** Every day without an LOR is a day the carrier might contact the client directly.

### 3.1 Gather Required Information

Find a document containing the claim number, policy number, and adjuster info (usually on carrier letters or estimates).

Enter the following into the CMS Insurance section:
- ✅ Insurance Company name
- ✅ Insured(s)
- ✅ Adjuster name and email
- ✅ Policy Amount and Deductible (if available)
- ✅ Coverage dates (if available)
- ✅ Policy Number
- ✅ Claim Number

**If adjuster info is unavailable, call the insurance company:**
> "This is [Name] from the Denham Property and Injury Law Firm. We have a mutual client, and I am calling to get their adjuster information."

Get the **email address**. If they can't provide the direct email, ask for the best general email.

### 3.2 Generate the LOR

1. In the CMS, navigate to the Insurance section → select the state-specific LOR template → Generate
2. Download the generated document and enable editing
3. **Verify and edit:**
   - ✅ Correct attorney's information on the LOR (→ see [decision tree below](#4-lor-template-selection-decision-tree))
   - ✅ Adjuster and insurance company info populated correctly (name, mailing address)
   - ✅ All insureds are listed (the CMS may only auto-populate one plaintiff for two-plaintiff cases)
4. Save as PDF to the **Intake** folder in the client's file

### 3.3 What a Real LOR Looks Like

Here's what the KY LOR template produces when filled in (anonymized):

## 6. Requesting Documents from Referral Sources / Contractors

### From Referral Sources

Wait until the client has signed. Download the signed ATR as a PDF and attach it to your email.

> Hi [Referral Source Name],
>
> I am emailing you to let you know we have signed up [Client Name]. Thank you for referring them to us! When you get the chance, can you please send me your claim file for this client?
>
> Thanks!
> [Your name]

### From Contractors

> Hi [Contractor Name],
>
> This is [Name] with the Denham Property and Injury Law Firm. Our firm has retained [client name], who we understand has used your services for [insert type of work done]. If you could send me any photos, reports, estimates, and/or invoices related to this claim as soon as you get the chance, that would be great.
>
> Thank you,
> [Signature]

- If no response within a day, **call to follow up**
- If you don't have direct contact info, call the company to find the right person
- Upload all documents to corresponding folders and update the team

## 10. Scanning & Filing Procedures

### 10.1 Scanning Physical Documents

1. Open the **Windows Scan** app
2. Select the appropriate source:
   - **Stack of documents** → Feeder
   - **Single-sided document or check** → Flatbed
3. Set File Type to **PDF**
4. If double-sided, enable **"Scan both sides"**
5. Save file to the corresponding client folder
6. Remove any staples before scanning
7. Ensure documents are in correct order
8. Click **Scan**

### 10.2 Processing Scanned Documents in Adobe

1. Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat
2. Under "All tools" → select **"Scan & OCR"** → **Recognize Text** → In this file
   - This makes the PDF searchable
3. If the file needs to be split (e.g., a stack from the insurance company containing policy, estimates, etc.):
   - Go to **Edit** → **Organize Pages**
   - Select the extract icon → **"Extract pages as separate files"**
   - Rename files according to naming convention
   - Save to corresponding folders

### 10.3 Physical Filing

1. Ensure documents are in correct order
2. Re-staple if necessary
3. Place each document type in a labeled manila folder
4. Place in the corresponding hanging folder in the file cabinet
5. If no hanging folder exists, create one: **Last Name, First Name** (alphabetical order)

## 11. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Sending LOR to the wrong email** — Double-check the adjuster email. Sending to a generic inbox may delay acknowledgment.
2. **Not including all insureds on the LOR** — If two people are on the policy, both names must be on the LOR. The CMS often only auto-populates one.
3. **Using the KY template for a non-KY case** — The KRS 304.14-100 paragraph only applies in Kentucky. Non-KY cases should use the non-KY template.
4. **Putting extra text in the subject line** — Subject line = claim number ONLY. Carriers use automated systems that parse subject lines.
5. **Forgetting to CC Bart and the CMS project email** — If it's not CC'd to the CMS, it doesn't get logged.
6. **Not following up on LOR within 2 days** — Carriers ignore LORs constantly. The follow-up is how we build the bad faith timeline.
7. **Not scanning mail immediately** — Physical mail sits in the inbox and gets lost. Scan the same day it arrives.

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For State Farm fire claims**, use `statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com` if you don't have the adjuster's email. This actually works better than trying to find the direct email.
2. **When the adjuster name is unknown**, call the carrier's main claims line. Say: "I represent [client name], claim number [X]. I need the assigned adjuster's name and email." They'll give it to you 95% of the time.
3. **Save the adjuster's email as a contact** — You'll email them repeatedly throughout the case.
4. **When a PA refers a client**, ask the PA for the claim file immediately. They usually have the adjuster info, estimates, photos, and correspondence already.
5. **Set a recurring 1-week task** to follow up on LORs until the carrier responds with documents. Some carriers take 3-4 follow-ups.
