## 1. Overview

After a client signs the ATR, there are two parallel tracks:
1. **Request documents from the client** — correspondence, estimates, photos, policy
2. **Send the Letter of Representation (LOR) to the insurance company** — this triggers the carrier to communicate through us and send their file

Both should happen as quickly as possible after signup.

## 2. Requesting Documents from the Client

### 2.1 Process
1. Intake specialist notifies the team that a new client has signed
2. Paralegal sends the following email:

> Good [morning/afternoon] [Client Name],
>
> Thank you for signing our Authority to Represent document. We look forward to working with you. At your earliest convenience, please send all documentation you have related to the claim. This includes correspondence with the insurance company, estimates, photos, reports, payments, your policy, etc. If you haven't already provided it, please include your claim and policy number as well.
>
> As a reminder, all future correspondence should go through our office. If the insurance company reaches out to you, please redirect them to our office; we can be reached at (859) 900-2278.
>
> Thank you again, please feel free to reach out with any updates, questions, or concerns.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Signature]

3. Upload documents to the corresponding CMS folders as they are received
4. Notify the team of new uploads

## 3. Letter of Representation (LOR)

⚠️ **Send the LOR ASAP after signing up the client.**

### 3.1 Gather Required Information

Find a document containing the claim number, policy number, and adjuster info (usually on carrier letters or estimates).

Enter the following into the CMS Insurance section:
- ✅ Insurance Company name
- ✅ Insured(s)
- ✅ Adjuster name and email
- ✅ Policy Amount and Deductible (if available)
- ✅ Coverage dates (if available)
- ✅ Policy Number
- ✅ Claim Number

**If adjuster info is unavailable, call the insurance company:**
> "This is [Name] from the Denham Property and Injury Law Firm. We have a mutual client, and I am calling to get their adjuster information."

Get the **email address**. If they can't provide the direct email, ask for the best general email.

### 3.2 Generate the LOR

1. In the CMS, navigate to the Insurance section → select the state-specific LOR template → Generate
2. Download the generated document and enable editing
3. **Verify and edit:**
   - ✅ Correct attorney's information on the LOR:
     - **KY cases → Hans**
     - **All other states → Bart**
   - ✅ Adjuster and insurance company info populated correctly (name, mailing address)
   - ✅ All insureds are listed (the CMS may only auto-populate one plaintiff for two-plaintiff cases)
4. Save as PDF to the **Intake** folder in the client's file

### 3.3 Send the LOR

1. Create a new email and attach the PDF
2. **Subject line:** Paste the claim number only — **no dashes, no other characters**
3. **To:** Adjuster's email address
4. **CC:** Bart's email, the CMS project email, and any other relevant email addresses
5. **Body:**

> Please see the attached letter of representation on behalf of Attorney [insert attorney name] regarding clients [insert plaintiff(s)' names]. Please acknowledge receipt and reply all to this email.

6. Send the LOR

⚠️ **For State Farm:** If you don't have the adjuster's email, use `statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com`

---

## 4. LOR Follow-Up

Set a task for **2 days** after the LOR is sent.

### Kentucky Claims Follow-Up

Reply to the original LOR email:

> Please acknowledge receipt and provide the requested information, failure to do so will be used as further evidence of bad faith.
>
> "Failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies" is a breach of KRS 304.12-230(2) Unfair Claims Settlement Practices.
>
> "Failing to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial of a claim or for the offer of a compromise settlement;" is a breach of KRS 304.12-230(14) Unfair Claims Settlement Practices.

### All Other States Follow-Up

> Following up on this. Please acknowledge receipt and provide the requested information.

⚠️ **WE DO NOT FOLLOW UP ON CONTRACTOR NEGLIGENCE LORs.**

Save anything the adjuster sends to the CMS and OneDrive backup.

## 5. Requesting Documents from Referral Sources / Contractors

### From Referral Sources

Wait until the client has signed. Download the signed ATR as a PDF and attach it to your email.

> Hi [Referral Source Name],
>
> I am emailing you to let you know we have signed up [Client Name]. Thank you for referring them to us! When you get the chance, can you please send me your claim file for this client?
>
> Thanks!
> [Your name]

### From Contractors

> Hi [Contractor Name],
>
> This is [Name] with the Denham Property and Injury Law Firm. Our firm has retained [client name], who we understand has used your services for [insert type of work done]. If you could send me any photos, reports, estimates, and/or invoices related to this claim as soon as you get the chance, that would be great.
>
> Thank you,
> [Signature]
