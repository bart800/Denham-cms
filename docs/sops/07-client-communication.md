## 1. Overview

**Client satisfaction and concierge-level service are our top priorities.**

Every client interaction reflects on the firm. Timely communication builds trust and prevents complaints. Proactive updates — even when there's nothing new — make clients feel cared for. Use the templates and procedures below to ensure consistent, professional updates.

---

## 2. Callback SLA

| Caller Type | Response Time |
|------------|---------------|
| **Potential Clients (before 4 PM)** | Same day callback |
| **Current Clients** | Within 24 hours |

⚠️ Potential client callbacks are only for cases we want — e.g., do NOT call back a car accident with no injuries.

**If a PC doesn't answer the callback:**
- Leave a voicemail
- Send intake form set to chase

→ See [SOP 01 — Intake & Signup](01-intake-and-signup.md) for full intake procedures.

---

## 3. Update Ownership

- The **primary attorney** or **assigned support staff** on the case is responsible for client updates
- After updating the client or responding to a request, **reply all** to the answering service email to confirm the update was handled
- The Office Manager keeps the answering service email distribution list up to date

---

## 4. Communication Cadence by Phase

| Case Phase | Update Frequency | Who Updates | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Intake / Pre-Suit** | Every 2 weeks minimum | Paralegal | Even if just "we're waiting for documents" |
| **Demand Sent** | At sending + when response received | Paralegal | Calendar the 14-day deadline and update client when it passes |
| **Litigation** | Every 2–3 weeks minimum | Paralegal/Attorney | More frequent during active discovery or motions |
| **Discovery** | As events occur + every 2 weeks | Paralegal | Client needs to know about interrogatories, depositions |
| **Settlement Negotiation** | As events occur (within 24 hours) | Attorney/Paralegal | Every offer and counteroffer communicated promptly |
| **Settlement Distribution** | Daily until complete | Paralegal/OM | Follow up every day alternating call/email |
| **PI — During Treatment** | Monthly check-in | Paralegal | Confirm treatment status, ask about new providers |

⚠️ **If a client calls asking for an update, that means we waited too long.** Be proactive.

## 5. Pre-Approved Client Update Scripts

These are scripts you can use **without attorney approval** for routine updates:

### Pre-Suit Phase

> "We are currently gathering all the necessary documents for your case. Once we have everything we need, we will prepare your demand letter and send it to the insurance company."

### Demand Sent

> "Your demand letter has been sent to the insurance company. They have 14 days from [date sent] to respond. We will let you know as soon as we hear back."

### Filing Suit

## 8. FAQ Responses for Common Client Questions

Use these pre-approved responses when clients ask common questions:

### "What is a statute of limitations?"

> A "Statute of Limitations" is simply the deadline for filing a lawsuit. Most lawsuits must be filed within a certain amount of time. Once the statute of limitations on a case "runs out," the legal claim is no longer valid. Each state sets different time limits for different types of cases.

### "What happens if my demand isn't paid?"

> If we have sent out your demand letter and payment is not received within fourteen (14) days, we immediately proceed with litigation seeking all available damages for your claim!

### "How long does this whole process take?"

> While it's challenging to provide an exact timeline for your case, here at Denham Property & Injury Law, we are committed to working diligently and efficiently to resolve your case as quickly as possible. We will keep you updated at every step and prioritize your case to ensure we achieve the best outcome in a timely manner. If you have any specific concerns or questions along the way, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here for you!

### "What are the other fees I may have to pay?"

> Our fee is a contingency fee, which means we only get paid if we recover for you. Costs and expenses (like filing fees, expert fees, etc.) are detailed in your contract and are deducted from any recovery.

### "If we lose, will I need to pay legal fees?"

> We only charge our contingency fee if we recover for you. If we do not recover anything for you, we do not charge our fees.

### "Is my insurance company going to drop me after they realize I got a lawyer?"

> Your insurance company is unlikely to drop you just because you've hired a lawyer. However, it would be a good idea to consider exploring new insurance options so you can find coverage that better meets your needs and helps prevent any future legal issues.

### "What constitutes 'Bad Faith' in my case?"

> Bad faith insurance claims happen when an insurance company breaches the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when handling a claim. This can include misrepresenting policy provisions, failing to investigate claims promptly, refusing to pay claims without a reasonable basis, or failing to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable time. Your attorney can explain how bad faith applies specifically to your case.

### "Can I make repairs?"

> ⚠️ **Escalate to attorney.** The answer depends on the case stage and specific circumstances.

### "Should I cash the first check they gave me?"

> ⚠️ **Escalate to attorney.** Do not advise the client to cash or not cash any insurance payment without attorney guidance.

## 10. What NOT to Tell Clients

⚠️ **Err on the side of caution — ALWAYS.**

| ❌ Never Say This | ✅ Say This Instead |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Your case is worth about $X" | "The attorney will discuss the value of your case with you" |
| "We should win this easily" | "We believe you have a strong case and we're working hard for you" |
| "The insurance company always does this" | "We've seen this type of response before and have strategies to address it" |
| "That's not really my area" | "Let me check with the team and get back to you" |
| "I don't know" (and leaving it there) | "That's a great question — let me find out and get back to you by [specific time]" |
| "We're really busy right now" | "Your case is a priority for us. Let me look into this and follow up" |
| Any legal advice (if you're not the attorney) | "I'll have the attorney contact you to discuss that" |
| Anything about another client's case | Never — confidentiality is absolute |
| Settlement predictions or timelines you're unsure of | "Every case is different. The attorney can give you a better idea of timeline" |

---

## 11. What NOT to Tell Insurance Company Defendants

⚠️ **Be ESPECIALLY cautious in what you say.**

- **Never volunteer information** — only respond to specific questions after getting guidance
- Take a message and either:
  - Ensure someone else reaches out to them, OR
  - Ask the attorney what to tell them exactly, then get back to them
- Don't share any case information you're unsure about
- Don't confirm or deny any facts about the case
- Don't discuss settlement amounts or case strategy

## 12. When to Escalate to the Attorney

### Escalate Immediately

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Client asks for legal advice | Only attorneys can give legal advice |
| Client wants to fire us | Retention issue — attorney needs to call |
| Client is angry or threatening | De-escalation by authority figure needed |
| Client asks about cashing insurance checks | Financial/legal decision requiring attorney input |
| Client reports new damage or injuries | May affect case strategy |
| Client mentions talking to the insurance company directly | Could harm the case |
| Client mentions hiring another lawyer | Potential conflict/withdrawal situation |
| Opposing counsel contacts us with settlement offer | Attorney decision required |
| Media inquiry about a case | Attorney only |
| Client asks about making repairs | Depends on case stage |

### Escalate by End of Day

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Client hasn't responded in 2+ weeks | May need warning letter |
| Discovery deadline approaching (< 7 days) | Attorney needs to prioritize |
| New documents received that change the case | Attorney review needed |
| Client reports changed circumstances | May affect case value |

## 14. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Not following up when promised** | Destroys client trust faster than anything | Set a CMS task for every promise you make |
| **Waiting for the client to call us** | Proactive firms get better reviews and fewer bar complaints | Follow the cadence schedule in Section 4 |
| **Giving legal advice as a paralegal** | Unauthorized practice of law — serious ethical violation | Always say "let me check with the attorney" |
| **Using "I don't know" without a follow-up** | Client feels abandoned | Always add "but I'll find out by [time]" |
| **Not logging communications in CMS** | Team doesn't know what's been said; duplicate efforts | Log every call, email, and voicemail in the Activity section |
| **Sending updates with wrong case details** | Embarrassing and unprofessional | Double-check names, amounts, and dates before sending |
| **Forgetting to update the PA** | Damages referral relationship | Calendar PA updates alongside client updates |
| **Responding to insurance company without attorney guidance** | Could harm the case | Take a message, always |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Batch your updates** — set aside 30–60 minutes each week to send proactive updates for all your cases
- **Use the pre-approved scripts** (Section 5) for routine updates — saves time and ensures consistency
- **When in doubt, over-communicate** — clients rarely complain about too many updates
- **Log everything** — if it's not in the CMS, it didn't happen
- **Reply all** to answering service emails so the whole team knows the message was handled
- **Set CMS reminders** for every follow-up promise you make to a client
- **Read the client's file** before calling them — know where the case stands so you sound informed
- **Personalize templates** — don't just copy/paste; add a sentence specific to their case
- **Morning routine:** Check answering service → check CMS tasks → check email → return calls
- **Friday routine:** Send weekly referral source updates to Bart for review
