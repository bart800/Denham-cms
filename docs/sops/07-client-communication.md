## 1. Overview

**Client satisfaction and concierge-level service are our top priorities.**

Every client interaction reflects on the firm. Timely communication builds trust and prevents complaints. Use the templates and procedures below to ensure consistent, professional updates.

---

## 2. Callback SLA

| Caller Type | Response Time |
|------------|---------------|
| **Potential Clients (before 4 PM)** | Same day callback |
| **Current Clients** | Within 24 hours |

⚠️ Potential client callbacks are only for cases we want — e.g., do NOT call back a car accident with no injuries.

If a PC doesn't answer the callback:
- Leave a voicemail
- Send intake form set to chase

---

## 3. Update Ownership

- The **primary attorney** or **assigned support staff** on the case is responsible for client updates
- After updating the client or responding to a request, **reply all** to the answering service email to confirm the update was handled
- The Office Manager keeps the answering service email distribution list up to date

---

## 4. What NOT to Tell Clients

⚠️ **Err on the side of caution.**

- Don't share information you're unsure about
- If you don't know the answer, tell the client you'll check with the team and get back to them
- **Always** follow through by the time you promised
- Don't speculate on case outcomes, timelines, or settlement amounts unless the attorney has provided specific guidance

---

## 5. What NOT to Tell Insurance Company Defendants

⚠️ **Be ESPECIALLY cautious in what you say.**

- Don't share any case information you're unsure about
- Take a message and either:
  - Ensure someone else reaches out to them, OR
  - Ask the attorney what to tell them exactly, then get back to them
- Never volunteer information — only respond to specific questions after getting guidance

---

## 6. Answering Service Message Handling

Messages from AnsweringLegal arrive via email notification or the app.

1. Check for answering service messages first thing each morning
2. Categorize the message:
   - **Potential client** → Intake team handles (same-day callback before 4 PM)
   - **Current client** → Assigned pod handles (within 24 hours)
3. Reply all to the answering service email once the client has been contacted
