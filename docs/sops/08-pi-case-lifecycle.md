## 1. Overview

Personal injury (PI) cases follow a different lifecycle than property insurance cases. This SOP covers the full PI case flow from intake through settlement or trial preparation. PI is the firm's secondary practice area.

---

## 2. Intake

1. **Confirm case viability:**
   - ✅ Venue is acceptable
   - ✅ Statute of Limitations (SOL) allows us to proceed
   - ✅ Type of case is one we handle (must involve injuries)
   - ✅ Fee structure discussed

2. **Get client signatures:**
   - ✅ Authority to Represent (contract)
   - ✅ Medical authorizations
   - ✅ Employment authorizations (if applicable)

3. **Conflict check:**
   - If two clients have a possible conflict → get a **waiver of conflict**
   - If conflict cannot be waived → refer to another attorney with a **fee split contract**

4. **Client intake questionnaire:**
   - Incident details
   - Treatment history
   - Health insurance company info
   - Provider names and contact info

5. **Calculate the lowest applicable SOL → calendar it immediately**

⚠️ **SOL calendaring is critical.** Missing a statute of limitations can result in case dismissal and malpractice liability.
