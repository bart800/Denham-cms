## 1. Overview

Personal injury (PI) cases follow a different lifecycle than property insurance cases. This SOP covers the full PI case flow from intake through settlement or trial preparation. PI is the firm's secondary practice area.

**Key Differences from Property Cases:**
- Medical records and treatment tracking are central
- Multiple claim types may overlap (BI, PIP, UIM)
- Liens must be identified, tracked, and negotiated
- Settlement distribution is more complex due to liens and subrogation

**Typical PI Case Timeline:**

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Intake + LORs | 1–2 weeks |
| Treatment (client treating) | 2–12 months |
| Records collection | 2–6 weeks after treatment complete |
| Demand preparation + negotiation | 1–3 months |
| Litigation (if needed) | 6–12 months |
| Settlement distribution | 2–4 weeks |

---

## 2. Intake

**⏱️ Expected Time: 20–30 minutes**

1. **Confirm case viability:**
   - ✅ Venue is acceptable
   - ✅ Statute of Limitations (SOL) allows us to proceed
   - ✅ Type of case is one we handle (must involve injuries)
   - ✅ Fee structure discussed

2. **Get client signatures:**
   - ✅ Authority to Represent (contract)
   - ✅ Medical authorizations
   - ✅ Employment authorizations (if applicable)

3. **Conflict check:**
   - If two clients have a possible conflict → get a **waiver of conflict**
   - If conflict cannot be waived → refer to another attorney with a **fee split contract**

4. **Client intake questionnaire:**
   - Incident details (date, location, how it happened)
   - Treatment history (who they've seen, where, when)
   - Health insurance company info
   - Provider names and contact info
   - Employment info (if wage loss claim)

5. **Calculate the lowest applicable SOL → calendar it immediately**

⚠️ **SOL calendaring is critical.** Missing a statute of limitations can result in case dismissal and malpractice liability.

→ See [SOP 01 — Intake & Signup](01-intake-and-signup.md) for general intake procedures.  
→ See [SOP 09 — Calendaring & Deadlines](09-calendaring-and-deadlines.md) for SOL deadlines by state.

## 3. Beginning of Case — LOR & Preservation

**⏱️ Expected Time: 1–2 hours for all LORs**

### 3.1 Send Letters of Representation

| Recipient | Purpose | Template |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **BI Carrier** (at-fault party's insurer) | Primary claim | Standard LOR |
| **Client's own carrier** | PIP, UM, and UIM coverage | PIP LOR (see Section 4) |
| Request declarations page from client's carrier | Coverage verification | Include in PIP LOR |
| **Possible lienholders** | Health insurance, Medicare, etc. | Lienholder LOR (see Section 5) |

### 3.2 Preservation Letters

Send preservation letters if needed — particularly to businesses with security cameras or other entities that may have evidence.

### 3.3 Records Requests

- Request a copy of the **police report**
- Do an **open records request** if a government agency is involved
- Request **medical and billing records** from all providers
  - → See [SOP 11 — Medical Records](11-medical-records.md) for full procedures

### 3.4 Confirm LOA (Letter of Acknowledgment)

- Confirm receipt of an LOA for each LOR sent
- If no LOA received within **2 business days**, follow up
- When received, add information from each LOA to the CMS:
  - Adjuster name
  - Subrogation company
  - Claim numbers

→ See [SOP 02 — Documents & LOR](02-documents-and-lor.md) for general LOR procedures.

## 4. PIP Letter of Representation Template

Use this template when sending LOR to the **client's own auto insurance carrier** for PIP benefits:

> **[Firm Letterhead]**
>
> [Date]
>
> Sent via [email/fax] to: [adjuster email/fax]
>
> [Adjuster Name]  
> [Insurance Company]  
> [Address]
>
> | | |
> |---|---|
> | **My Client/Your Insured:** | [Client Name] |
> | **Date of Loss:** | [Date of crash] |
> | **Claim #:** | [Claim number] |
>
> **PIP LETTER OF REPRESENTATION**
>
> Dear [Mr./Ms. Adjuster Name]:
>
> Please be advised that this office represents the above-named client(s) for injuries arising out of the above referenced claim. Enclosed is an executed Application for Kentucky "No Fault" Benefits for each client. Within **THREE** days, please send this office a written acknowledgement of your handling of the claim, along with a copy of the Declarations of Coverage for all policies covering this claim. If there is a deductible for PIP benefits, please apply medical billing towards the deductible. Lost wages and/or prescriptions should not be used to meet the deductible and should be paid as soon as the deductible has been met. **At this time, please reserve $2,000 in benefits for lost wages.**
>
> Please **REFRAIN FROM PAYING THE EMERGENCY ROOM BILL RELATIVE TO THIS CLAIM IF IT EXCEEDS $2,000** until advised otherwise, but proceed with paying providers other billing which you receive. Do not pay any health insurance subrogation or liens, including any subrogation or liens from Medicaid or Medicare, without our permission and direction. In addition, please provide this office with a copy of your PIP ledger once every month, **whether or not payments are processed**. These PIP Ledgers should be emailed to [ASSISTANT'S EMAIL] and faxed to [ASSISTANT'S FAX].
>
> Additionally, as a precaution, **please assign a UIM adjuster to this claim** if my client had any applicable UIM coverage at the time of the date of loss and have them contact our office with his/her contact information. If you claim my client had no applicable UIM coverage under any policy, please forward to my office copies of any written rejection of UM or UIM coverage signed by my client. Should it be the position of your office that further information (to specifically include a statement from the client) is needed (other than medical billing and wage documentation) before my client's bills, wages and prescriptions can be processed for payment, please provide this office with statutory and policy language substantiating your position within one week. Additionally, contact this office within one week to obtain this further information. Otherwise, this office will assume that you have been provided everything necessary from this office and the insured to proceed with making payments on the claim and will deem non-payment as a failure to act in accordance with KRS 304.39., et. Seq.
>
> For your convenience, I would like to remind you that Kentucky Law requires you to extend responsive communications to this office within 15 days of your notice of an inquiry. There is also a requirement to review claims for settlement and respond to them in good faith within 30 days of being presented with a demand. Finally, if additional time is ever required, an insurer must notify the insured or their agent or representative within 45 days of the initial notification, and every 45 days thereafter, setting forth the reasons that additional time is needed. 806 Ky. Admin. Regs 12:095 (2006).
>
> Please direct all inquiries concerning your insured through this office and do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> [Attorney Signature Block]

### Key Points About the PIP LOR

- **Reserve $2,000 for lost wages** — this is standard practice
- **ER bill hold** — don't let them pay the ER bill if it exceeds $2,000 until you say so (preserves PIP for other bills)
- **Request monthly PIP ledgers** — track what's been paid and what remains
- **Request UIM adjuster assignment** — do this proactively even if UIM isn't needed yet
- **Request dec pages** — need to verify all coverages

2. Ask: "Are you still treating? Have you seen any new providers?"
3. Log treatment status in CMS
4. When client reports they're done → confirm with the provider
5. Request final records and bills
6. **Only then** proceed to demand preparation

## 9. PIP Claim Procedures

### What Is PIP?

PIP (Personal Injury Protection) is **no-fault** coverage from the client's own auto insurance policy. In Kentucky, PIP covers:
- Medical expenses (up to policy limits, typically $10,000)
- Lost wages (up to policy limits)
- Prescriptions

### When to File PIP

- **Immediately** — PIP should be activated at the beginning of every KY auto accident case
- Send the PIP LOR (Section 4) with the Application for No-Fault Benefits

### PIP Deadlines (Kentucky)

| Deadline | Timeframe |
|----------|-----------|
| File PIP application | As soon as possible after accident |
| PIP benefits must be paid | Within 30 days of receipt of proof of claim |
| PIP statute of limitations | 2 years from date of accident OR 2 years from last PIP payment |

### PIP Management

1. **Request monthly PIP ledgers** from the carrier
2. **Track PIP balance** — know how much has been paid and how much remains
3. **Reserve $2,000 for lost wages** (per PIP LOR)
4. **Hold ER bill** if it exceeds $2,000 — preserve PIP for ongoing treatment
5. **Do NOT let the carrier pay subrogation/liens from PIP** without our direction
6. At settlement, **PIP subrogation** must be addressed in the distribution

---

## 10. UIM/UM Claim Procedures

### Definitions

| Coverage | What It Covers |
|----------|---------------|
| **UM (Uninsured Motorist)** | Defendant has NO insurance |
| **UIM (Underinsured Motorist)** | Defendant's policy limits are less than client's damages |

### When to Pursue UIM

- Client's damages exceed the at-fault party's policy limits
- Client has UIM coverage on their own policy
- UIM is the **difference** between client's UIM limits and defendant's BI limits

### UIM Procedure

1. **At case start:** Request dec pages from client's carrier (included in PIP LOR)
2. **Verify UIM coverage exists** — check for signed rejection forms
3. **Request UIM adjuster assignment** (included in PIP LOR)
4. **After BI settlement:** Notify UIM carrier of the BI settlement amount
5. **Present UIM demand** showing total damages exceed BI recovery
6. **Negotiate UIM claim** separately

⚠️ **Important:** Some states require the UIM carrier to consent before settling the BI claim. Check state-specific rules.

→ See [SOP 09 — Calendaring & Deadlines](09-calendaring-and-deadlines.md) for UIM filing deadlines by state.

---

## 11. Decision Tree: BI vs PIP vs UIM — Which Claims to File

```
MVA Case Intake
│
├── Was the client at fault?
│   ├── YES → PIP only (from client's own policy)
│   └── NO → Continue ↓
│
├── Does the at-fault party have insurance?
│   ├── NO → File UM claim (client's policy) + PIP
│   └── YES → Continue ↓
│
├── File BI Claim against at-fault party's insurer
├── File PIP Claim with client's own insurer
│
├── Are client's damages likely to exceed at-fault's policy limits?
│   ├── YES → Also file UIM claim (client's policy)
│   └── NO → BI + PIP should be sufficient
│
└── Does client have health insurance that paid for treatment?
    ├── YES → Send Lienholder LOR → Track lien for distribution
    └── NO → No lienholder involvement
```

### Quick Reference Table

| Claim Type | Filed Against | When to File | Key Deadline |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **BI** | At-fault party's insurer | When liability is clear | SOL (varies by state) |
| **PIP** | Client's own insurer | Immediately at case start | 2 years (KY) |
| **UM** | Client's own insurer | When defendant is uninsured | SOL (varies by state) |
| **UIM** | Client's own insurer | When BI limits insufficient | SOL (varies by state) |
| **Lienholder** | N/A (notification only) | At case start | 30-day response window |

---

## 12. Beginning of Litigation

**⏱️ Expected Time: Complaint drafting 2–4 hours | Filing 30–60 min**

If negotiations fail or liability is denied:

1. **Contact client** and explain next steps — get approval to litigate
   - ⚠️ Attorney fees usually increase when suit is filed — need client permission
2. **Prepare suit and discovery requests**
3. **File suit and discovery requests**
4. Add case info to CMS: case number, county, judge, etc.
5. Save case expenses to file
6. **Send courtesy copy** of filed suit to adverse insurance companies

→ See [SOP 04 — Complaints & Filing](04-complaints-and-filing.md) for filing procedures.

---

## 13. Discovery Phase

### 13.1 Service Follow-Up

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 20 days after filing | Check if parties are served |
| If not served | Follow up; serve again as needed |
| 30 days after service | Check if answer has been filed |
| Answer filed | Add counsel name/info to CMS |
| No answer | Contact defendant carriers |
| Still no answer | Move for default judgment |

### 13.2 Defendant's Discovery

- If we receive discovery requests → save and calendar due date
- Complete our discovery responses and serve on opposing parties
- → See [SOP 05 — Discovery](05-discovery.md) for full discovery procedures

### 13.3 Our Discovery

- Follow up in **30 days** to confirm defendants replied
- If no reply → send letter of reminder
- If **30+ days late** → file Motion to Compel

### 13.4 Depositions

- Determine if OC wants to depose our client → schedule and prep client
- Determine whether to depose defendant
- Ensure deposition is paid for and added to expenses

### 13.5 Expert Witnesses

- Determine whether experts are needed
- If so, consult expert and get a report
- Provide report to defendants as part of discovery

---

## 14. Lien Negotiation Procedures

### Why Negotiate Liens?

Medical liens and health insurance subrogation can significantly reduce the client's net recovery. Negotiating liens down increases the client's take-home.

### Types of Liens

| Lien Type | Typical Negotiation | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Health insurance subrogation** | 30–50% reduction | Governed by plan terms (ERISA vs state law) |
| **Hospital liens** | 20–40% reduction | Must be perfected to be valid |
| **Medicare/Medicaid** | Limited — federal rules apply | Must use Medicare Secondary Payer process |
| **Medical provider liens** | 25–50% reduction | Often willing to negotiate |
| **PIP subrogation** | Usually full amount | But confirm with carrier |

### Lien Negotiation Procedure

1. **Request updated lien amounts** from all lienholders (in writing)
2. **Calculate the client's net** after fees, costs, and full liens
3. **If net to client is unreasonably low**, negotiate:
   - Send a letter explaining: total recovery, attorney fees, costs, and what client would net
   - Ask the lienholder to reduce their claim proportionally
   - Common argument: "If we hadn't pursued this case, you would have recovered nothing"
4. **Get any lien reduction in writing** before distributing
5. **Document all negotiations** in CMS

### When to Negotiate

- **Before settlement:** Know your lien exposure so you can negotiate settlement amount accordingly
- **After settlement:** Negotiate liens down to maximize client's net recovery
- **Always get final payoff amounts in writing** with payment instructions

---

## 15. Settlement During Litigation

Once discovery is complete:

1. **Confirm medical records are up to date**
2. **Add related costs** to case expenses
3. **Contact lienholders** and request updated liens — document liens at face value
4. **Contact PIP carrier** to check remaining PIP balance
5. **Contact opposing parties** about mediation
   - Some venues require mediation — determine if ours does
   - If parties won't mediate → move for a pretrial/trial date
   - ⚠️ **Calendar any trial deadlines — VERY VERY IMPORTANT**
   - Trial orders usually contain a mediation requirement

### Mediation Preparation

**⏱️ Expected Time: 4–8 hours total preparation**

1. Find an agreeable mediator
2. Contact all parties to schedule
3. Pay mediator deposit and sign release (if required)
4. Update liens
5. Confirm payment status of medical bills
6. Determine total case expenses
7. Prepare mediation statements and calculations
8. Prepare in-house mediation prep documents
9. Send mediation statement to mediator
10. **Mediate the case**
11. Pay the mediator

If case settles → proceed to Settlement Procedures (Section 17)  
If case doesn't settle → proceed to Trial Prep (Section 18)

## 19. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Not sending PIP LOR immediately** | Delays PIP payments; client's bills go unpaid | Send PIP LOR within 48 hours of intake |
| **Forgetting to request UIM adjuster** | Miss potential UIM coverage | Included in PIP LOR template — use it |
| **Sending demand before client finishes treatment** | Undervalues the case; can't supplement easily | Monthly check-ins; confirm with provider before demand |
| **Not tracking PIP ledger monthly** | Don't know what's been paid; distribution errors | Calendar monthly PIP ledger request |
| **Forgetting liens at distribution** | Ethical violation; lienholder can pursue client | Send lienholder LORs at case start; track all liens |
| **Not getting lien reductions in writing** | Lienholder disputes amount later | Always get written confirmation before distributing |
| **Missing the PIP statute of limitations** | Client loses PIP benefits | Calendar PIP SOL at intake |
| **Not requesting dec pages** | Don't know coverage limits; miss UIM | Included in PIP LOR template |
| **Release not "exclusive of PIP"** | Client's PIP rights waived | Review every release carefully |
| **Not sending courtesy copy to carriers after filing** | Carriers don't know about suit; delays process | Add to post-filing checklist |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start PIP immediately** — it pays for treatment while you build the BI case
- **Request dec pages from all carriers** — you need to know all available coverage
- **Monthly PIP ledger reviews** help you know when PIP is running low — plan accordingly
- **Negotiate liens BEFORE telling the client the net amount** — manage expectations
- **Keep a running expense log** — don't try to reconstruct costs at settlement time
- **For open-ended demands**, always include the Coots v. Allstate language (in the template)
- **Photos are powerful** — always include crash photos and injury photos in demands
- **Police reports** — cite favorable language directly in the demand letter
- **Wage loss claims** need employer documentation — get this early, not at demand time
- **Calendar everything** — every deadline, every follow-up, every promise to a client
