## 1. Overview

Appraisal is a dispute resolution process **specific to property insurance cases** where the parties disagree on the **amount of loss** (not whether the loss is covered). Most property insurance policies contain an appraisal clause that either party can invoke.

**Key distinction:**
- **Appraisal** = disputes over the **dollar amount** of damage
- **Litigation/Mediation** = disputes over **coverage** (whether the loss is covered at all)

If the carrier says "we agree it's covered but we think the damage is $5,000" and we say it's $25,000, appraisal is often the fastest resolution.

## 2. When to Invoke Appraisal

```
Is there a dispute about the AMOUNT of loss?
├── YES → Is coverage itself disputed?
│   ├── NO → ✅ Appraisal is a good option
│   │   └── Does the policy have an appraisal clause?
│   │       ├── YES → Proceed with appraisal
│   │       └── NO → Must litigate or mediate
│   └── YES → ⚠️ Appraisal may not resolve coverage disputes
│       └── Litigation or mediation is likely needed
│           (Can invoke appraisal for amount AFTER coverage is resolved)
│
└── NO → Appraisal is not applicable
```

### Good Candidates for Appraisal
- Carrier acknowledged a covered loss but paid far less than the actual repair cost
- Carrier's estimate omits entire categories of damage (e.g., missing the HVAC, gutters, interior damage)
- Multiple conflicting estimates exist
- The dispute is purely about numbers, not coverage interpretation

### Poor Candidates for Appraisal
- Carrier denied the claim entirely (coverage dispute)
- Carrier claims the damage is from a non-covered peril (e.g., "that's wear and tear, not storm damage")
- Policy interpretation is at issue

## 3. The Appraisal Clause

Most property insurance policies contain language similar to:

> **Appraisal.** If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the "residence premises" is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of loss. Each party will pay its own appraiser and bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

**Key points from the clause:**
- Either party can demand appraisal
- Each side picks their own appraiser (within 20 days typically)
- The two appraisers pick an umpire
- Agreement by any 2 of the 3 sets the loss amount
- Each party pays their own appraiser; umpire cost split 50/50

## 4. How the Appraisal Process Works

```
Step 1: One party invokes appraisal (written demand)
            │
Step 2: Each party selects their appraiser (within 20 days)
            │
Step 3: The two appraisers select an umpire (within 15 days)
            │
            ├── If they can't agree on umpire → Court appoints one
            │
Step 4: Appraisers independently inspect the property
            │
Step 5: Appraisers independently estimate the loss
            │
            ├── If both agree → Written award (binding)
            │
            └── If they disagree → Submit differences to umpire
                    │
                    └── Umpire + either appraiser = binding award
                            (agreement by any 2 of 3)
```

**Timeline:** The entire process typically takes **4–8 weeks** from invocation to award.

## 5. Invoking Appraisal — Step by Step

### Step 1: Attorney Decision
Bart decides whether to invoke appraisal based on case facts. This is a strategic decision.

### Step 2: Draft the Appraisal Demand Letter
Send a formal written demand to the carrier invoking the appraisal clause:

> Dear [Adjuster/OC Name],
>
> On behalf of our clients, [Client Name(s)], we hereby invoke the appraisal provision contained in the policy, Policy Number [X], issued by [Insurance Company].
>
> The parties have been unable to agree on the amount of loss arising from the [date of loss] [type of loss] at [property address]. Pursuant to the appraisal clause, each party shall select a competent and impartial appraiser within twenty (20) days.
>
> We have selected [Appraiser Name] as our appraiser. Please identify your appraiser within the time period specified in the policy.
>
> Please acknowledge receipt of this demand.

### Step 3: Calendar Deadlines
- **20 days:** Carrier must select their appraiser
- **15 days after both appraisers selected:** Umpire must be chosen
- Follow up if deadlines are missed

### Step 4: Update CMS
- Change case phase to "Appraisal"
- Log all appraisal-related documents in the file

---

## 6. Selecting an Appraiser

### Our Appraiser
- Bart selects or recommends the appraiser
- The appraiser should be:
  - Licensed and qualified in the relevant state
  - Experienced with the type of loss (roof, fire, water)
  - Known to produce thorough, well-supported estimates
- Our public adjusters (Brandi Carroll, Winning the Claim, etc.) may serve as appraisers or recommend qualified individuals

### Their Appraiser
- The insurance company will select their own appraiser
- We have no control over their selection
- Document who they select and any potential conflicts of interest

---

## 7. The Umpire Process

If the two appraisers cannot agree on the loss amount, they select an umpire.

### Umpire Selection
1. Our appraiser and their appraiser attempt to agree on an umpire (15 days)
2. If they can't agree, either party may petition the court to appoint one
3. The umpire should be neutral — not affiliated with either side

### Umpire's Role
- Reviews both appraisers' estimates
- May conduct an independent inspection
- Makes a determination on disputed items
- Agreement by any 2 of the 3 (our appraiser + umpire, their appraiser + umpire, or both appraisers) = binding award

---

## 8. Appraisal Award

The appraisal award sets the **amount of loss** — it's a binding determination of what the damage costs.

### What the Award Includes
- Itemized repair/replacement costs
- Scope of damage
- May address ALE and contents if disputed

### What the Award Does NOT Address
- Coverage questions
- Bad faith claims
- Attorney's fees
- Consequential damages

### After the Award is Issued
→ See [Section 9](#9-after-the-appraisal-award) below

---

## 9. After the Appraisal Award

### If the Award Favors Our Client

1. Send the award to the carrier with a demand for payment
2. Apply the same formula as [SOP 03 § Settlement Breakdown](03-demand-drafting-and-service.md#7-settlement-breakdown-calculation):
   ```
   Award Amount - Deductible - Prior Payments = Amount Due
   ```
3. Set a payment deadline (14 days for KY, 60 days for MT)
4. If carrier pays → proceed to [SOP 06 — Settlement](06-settlement-and-distribution.md)
5. If carrier doesn't pay → bad faith claim strengthened, proceed to litigation

### If the Award is Lower Than Expected

1. Discuss with Bart whether to:
   - Accept the award and settle
   - Continue litigation on coverage/bad faith issues (appraisal only resolved amount, not coverage)
2. The appraisal award is generally binding on the amount question

## 10. Appraisal vs. Mediation vs. Litigation

| Factor | Appraisal | Mediation | Litigation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **What it resolves** | Amount of loss only | Any dispute (amount, coverage, bad faith) | Everything |
| **Binding?** | Yes (on amount) | Only if parties agree | Yes (after judgment) |
| **Timeline** | 4-8 weeks | 1 day (session) + scheduling | 6-18 months |
| **Cost** | Appraiser fee + ½ umpire | Mediator fee (split) | Filing + discovery + trial |
| **Who decides** | Appraisers + umpire | Parties (mediator facilitates) | Judge/jury |
| **Best for** | Dollar amount disputes | Any dispute; parties willing to negotiate | Coverage denials, bad faith |
| **Preserves bad faith claim?** | Yes | Settles all claims | Litigates all claims |

## 11. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Invoking appraisal when the dispute is about coverage** — Appraisal resolves amount, not coverage. If the carrier denied the claim, appraisal won't help.
2. **Not calendaring the 20-day and 15-day deadlines** — Missing these weakens our position and delays the process.
3. **Selecting a biased appraiser** — The policy requires "competent and impartial." An appraiser with clear bias can be challenged.
4. **Forgetting that appraisal doesn't resolve bad faith** — Even after a favorable appraisal award, the bad faith claim is separate and can still be litigated.
5. **Not documenting the carrier's delay in the appraisal process** — If they drag their feet selecting an appraiser or umpire, document it — it supports bad faith claims.

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Appraisal is often faster and cheaper than litigation** for pure dollar amount disputes. If coverage isn't at issue, consider it early.
2. **The appraisal award STRENGTHENS bad faith claims** — If the award comes back at $50K and the carrier only paid $5K, that's strong evidence of bad faith.
3. **You can litigate AND invoke appraisal** — They're not mutually exclusive. The court may stay litigation pending appraisal completion.
4. **Keep records of the carrier's conduct during appraisal** — If they delay selecting an appraiser, refuse to cooperate, or try to influence the umpire, document everything.
5. **Some carriers prefer appraisal** — It limits their exposure to bad faith damages. Be strategic about when to invoke vs. when to litigate.
