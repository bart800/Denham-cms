## 1. Overview

The settlement process covers everything from accepting a settlement offer through distributing funds to the client. This is one of the most critical SOPs — errors here can result in trust account violations, bar complaints, and malpractice exposure.

**Full process flow:**

```
Settlement Offer Accepted → Receive Settlement Docs → Contact Client →
Get Signatures/Notarization → Deposit Check into IOLTA → Wait 10 Business Days →
Calculate Distribution → Get Client Approval → Distribute Funds → Close File
```

**⏱️ Time Expectations:**

| Task | Expected Time |
|------|--------------|
| Process settlement packet (scan, split, rename, save) | 30–45 min |
| Contact client and coordinate signatures | 15–30 min per attempt |
| Prepare distribution calculation | 20–30 min |
| Print and mail checks | 15–20 min |
| Full cycle (offer to distribution) | 2–4 weeks |

---

## 2. Settlement Offer Process

When presenting a settlement offer to Opposing Counsel:

1. **Get authorization to settle** from the client — document the date, time, and amount authorized
2. **Attach the firm's W9** to the settlement communication
3. **Request check be issued to:**

### Preferred Format (Single Check)

> **Bart Denham Law PLLC F.B.O. [Insured Name(s)], [PA Name if applicable], [Mortgage Company if applicable]**

### Alternative Format (Split Check)

> ½ to **Bart Denham Law PLLC F.B.O. [Insured Name(s)], [PA Name]**  
> ½ to **the Mortgage Company and Client**

4. **Confirm with the client** that they have the same mortgage company on file — mortgage companies change, and the wrong payee creates major problems

→ See [SOP 03 — Demand Drafting](03-demand-drafting-and-service.md) for demand letter procedures that precede settlement offers.

## 5. Contacting the Client

### 5.1 Call the Client

**If they answer:**

> "Hello, this is [your name] from Denham Property & Injury Law Firm. We received the settlement amount of [amount]. To distribute the settlement, you need to come into the office to endorse the check."

**If they cannot come into the office:**

> "We will send you an email with instructions — we will need you to get a Power of Attorney notarized and sent back to us. We can help you set up an online notary if needed."

**If they do not answer:**

Leave a voicemail asking them to call back, then send the email below.

### 5.2 Email Templates

### 5.3 Follow-Up Cadence

⚠️ **Follow up with the client every day, alternating between calling and sending an email.** Do not let days go by without attempting contact.

→ See [SOP 07 — Client Communication](07-client-communication.md) for general communication procedures and escalation paths.

---

## 6. Unresponsive Client Procedures

If a client is not responding to daily follow-ups after multiple attempts, escalate with the following warning letter:

>
> /s/ [Attorney Name]

### Unresponsive Client Decision Tree

| Attempts Made | Next Step |
|--------------|-----------|
| 3+ calls/emails, no response in 1 week | Send warning letter (above) via certified mail |
| Warning letter sent, 14 days passed, no response | Escalate to attorney — may need to withdraw or hold funds |
| Client responds after warning | Resume normal process, document the gap |
| Client disputes receiving communications | Confirm mailing address and email, resend everything |

- Set up the appointment:
  - Add the client's email for the video call link
  - Have the finalized document and bill come to our office (use your email)
  - Pay the bill and download documents when received
- Client needs a webcam

## 10. Distribution Calculation Formula

### The Formula

```
Total Recovery = Undisputed Payment(s) + Settlement Amount

Attorney Fees = Total Recovery × Fee Percentage (from contract)

Net to Client = Total Recovery - Attorney Fees - Costs/Expenses - PA Fee
```

### Fee Percentage Decision

| Scenario | Fee % |
|----------|-------|
| Pre-suit settlement (no complaint filed) | Pre-litigation percentage (per contract) |
| Post-filing settlement (complaint filed) | Litigation percentage (per contract) |

⚠️ **Look in the client's file to determine if a complaint was filed** — this determines which fee percentage applies.

### Worked Example — Property Case with PA

```
Settlement Check:                          $45,000.00
Previous Undisputed Payment:             + $12,000.00
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Recovery:                            $57,000.00

Attorney Fees (33.33% pre-suit):         - $18,998.10
Costs/Expenses:
  Filing fee:                            -    $363.00
  Mailing/service fees:                  -     $47.50
  Expert report:                         -    $750.00
Public Adjuster Fee (10%):               -  $5,700.00
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net to Client:                             $31,141.40
```

### Worked Example — PI Case with Liens

```
Settlement Amount:                         $75,000.00

Attorney Fees (33.33% pre-suit):         - $24,997.50
Costs/Expenses:
  Medical records fees:                  -    $125.00
  Filing fee:                            -    $363.00
  Mediator fee:                          -  $1,500.00
  Deposition cost:                       -    $800.00
Medical Liens:
  Health insurance subrogation:          -  $8,500.00
  Hospital lien:                         -  $3,200.00
PIP Subrogation:                         -  $2,500.00
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net to Client:                             $33,014.50
```

## 11. Distribution Statement Preparation

**⏱️ Expected Time: 20–30 minutes**

### 11.1 Create Distribution Spreadsheet

Include all of the following:

- **Total settlement amount** (include undisputed if applicable)
- **Attorney's fees** (per contract percentage — verify pre-suit vs litigation)
- **Costs / Expenses:**
  - Filing fee (always if complaint filed, usually ~$300)
  - Mailing fees
  - Expert fees
  - Mediator fees (PI cases)
  - Deposition costs (PI cases)
- **Public Adjuster fees** (check PA contract — **cannot exceed 10%**)
  - ⚠️ PA is the only other party we distribute fees to besides the client (in property cases)
- **Liens** (PI cases — medical liens, health insurance subrogation, PIP subrogation)
- **Net to client**

### 11.2 Review Process

1. Email the distribution spreadsheet to **Bart for review**
2. Once approved, email the settlement breakdown to the client
3. Ask for POA if needed
4. Request a Google review

### 11.3 Log in CMS

- Enter all settlement data (amount, fees, costs, net)

---

## 12. Authority to Distribute Funds

>
> _________________________  
> (client name)

⚠️ This must be signed before any checks are printed or mailed.

---

## 13. Direction to Pay Form

> **Direction to Pay Form**
>
> **Insured Information:**  
> Insured(s): ______________________________________________________________  
> Address: ____________________________________  
> Policy Number: ______________________________

## 14. Mortgage Company Procedures

### When Is a Mortgage Company Involved?

- Property insurance settlement checks where there is an active mortgage on the property
- The mortgage company is typically listed as a loss payee on the insurance policy
- They **must** endorse the settlement check if their name is on it

### Procedure

1. **At settlement offer stage:** Confirm with client their current mortgage company (it may have changed since the policy was issued)
2. **When check arrives:** Check if mortgage company is listed as a payee
3. **If mortgage company IS on the check:**
   - Contact the mortgage company's loss draft department
   - Provide: claim number, policy number, client name, settlement amount
   - Follow their endorsement procedures (may require mailing the check to them)
   - ⚠️ This can add **2–4 weeks** to the distribution timeline
4. **Alternative — split checks:**
   - Request ½ to the mortgage company and client, ½ to Bart Denham Law PLLC FBO client/PA
   - This avoids the mortgage company endorsement delay on the firm's portion

### Decision Tree

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Active mortgage + property settlement | Must include mortgage company |
| Mortgage recently paid off | Get payoff confirmation letter, proceed without |
| Client refinanced (new lender) | Update payee info before requesting check |
| No mortgage | No mortgage company needed |

---

## 15. Client Won't Sign Release

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Client disagrees with settlement terms | Schedule a call with the attorney to discuss; document concerns |
| Client wants more money | Explain the settlement was already agreed to; attorney may need to intervene |
| Client is confused about the release language | Walk through each section; have attorney call if needed |
| Client refuses to sign | Do NOT distribute any funds; escalate to attorney immediately |
| Client wants changes to release | Forward to attorney — only attorney can negotiate release terms with OC |

⚠️ **Never pressure a client to sign a release.** If they have concerns, the attorney must address them.

---

## 16. Check Printing & Mailing

**⏱️ Expected Time: 15–20 minutes**

1. **Confirm mailing address** with the client (call or email — do not assume old address is current)
2. Print checks for:
   - ✅ Client
   - ✅ Lienholders (if applicable — PI cases)
   - ✅ PA (if applicable — property cases)
   - ✅ Mortgage company (if applicable)
3. Mail to confirmed addresses
4. Log mailing date in CMS

---

## 17. Release Return & AOD Filing

1. Have the client execute the release
2. Send the executed release to Opposing Counsel
3. Sign the Agreed Order of Dismissal (AOD) and return to OC
4. Confirm the AOD is filed and entered with the court
5. Confirm all checks clear
6. **Close the file** in CMS

→ See [SOP 09 — Calendaring & Deadlines](09-calendaring-and-deadlines.md) for deadline tracking on AOD filing.

---

## 18. Follow-Up & Google Review

Request a Google review from the client. Follow-up schedule:

| Attempt | Timing |
|---------|--------|
| 1st request | At settlement distribution |
| 2nd follow-up | 1 week later |
| 3rd follow-up | 2 weeks after that |
| Final follow-up | 1 month after that |

---

## 19. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Wrong payee on check** | Check must be reissued — adds weeks of delay | Triple-check payee names before sending payment instructions to OC |
| **Forgetting the mortgage company** | Check can't be cashed; must be reissued | Always ask client about current mortgage at settlement offer stage |
| **Not confirming mailing address** | Check goes to old address; security risk | Call/email client to confirm address before mailing ANY check |
| **Disbursing before 10 business day hold** | Trust account violation; regulatory exposure | Use date calculator and calendar the earliest disbursement date |
| **Using wrong fee percentage** | Overcharging or undercharging client | Check if complaint was filed → litigation % vs pre-suit % |
| **Forgetting PA fee** | PA doesn't get paid; damages referral relationship | Always check if PA is involved and review PA contract for fee % |
| **Not scanning check immediately** | If check is lost, no record exists | Scan front AND back the moment it arrives |
| **Sending release with firm signature block** | Ethical violation — firm cannot sign releases | Review every release for signature blocks; remove any for the firm |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Prepare distribution calculations during the 10 business day hold** — don't waste the waiting period
- **Keep a settlement tracking spreadsheet** with dates for every step — Bart and the team need visibility
- **For PI cases:** Request updated lien payoffs right when settlement is reached — don't wait until check arrives
- **Calendar the 10 business day hold end date** so you're ready to distribute the moment it clears
- **Always send the distribution breakdown to Bart first** before sharing with the client
- **Double-check math** on every distribution statement — errors erode client trust
- **For split checks:** This is often faster when a mortgage company is involved — suggest it proactively
- **Save all executed documents** (release, AOD, authority to distribute) to both CMS and OneDrive backup
