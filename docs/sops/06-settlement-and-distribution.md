## 1. Overview

The settlement process covers everything from accepting a settlement offer through distributing funds to the client. Key steps: receive settlement docs → contact client → get signatures/notarization → deposit check → wait 10 business days → calculate distribution → distribute funds → close file.

## 2. Settlement Offer Process

When presenting a settlement offer to Opposing Counsel:

1. **Get authorization to settle** from the client
2. **Attach the firm's W9**
3. **Request check be issued to:**

**Preferred format:**
> Bart Denham Law PLLC F.B.O. [Insured Name(s)], [PA Name if applicable], [Mortgage Company if applicable]

**Alternative (split check):**
> ½ to Bart Denham Law PLLC F.B.O. [Insured Name(s)], [PA Name]
> ½ to the Mortgage Company and Client

4. Confirm with the client that they have the same mortgage company on file

## 3. Receiving the Settlement Packet

2. Download the settlement packet
3. Open in Adobe Acrobat:
   - **All tools** → **Scan & OCR** → **Recognize Text** → In this file (makes PDF searchable)
   - **Edit** → **Organize Pages** → Extract pages as separate files
4. Split into separate PDFs:
   - ✅ Settlement Letter
   - ✅ Check
   - ✅ Agreed Order of Dismissal (AOD)
   - ✅ Settlement Agreement and Release
5. Rename files and save to the Settlement folder

## 4. Contacting the Client

### 4.1 Call the Client

**If they answer:**

> Hello, this is [your name] from Denham Property & Injury Law Firm. We received the settlement amount of [amount]. To distribute the settlement, you need to come into the office to endorse the check.

**If they cannot come into the office:**

> We will send you an email with instructions — we will need you to get a Power of Attorney notarized and sent back to us. We can help you set up an online notary if needed.

**If they do not answer:**

Leave a voicemail asking them to call back, then send the email below.

### 4.2 Email Templates

#### If Client CAN Come to the Office

> Good morning [Client Name],
>
> I am emailing you to follow up on our phone call. We received a settlement check in the amount of $[amount] for your case (see attached). In order to distribute this to you, we will need you to endorse this check and get the Settlement Agreement and Release notarized (see attached). Once notarized please bring the document into our office when you come to endorse the check. Please let us know when you will be coming by. Thank you!

#### If Client CANNOT Come to the Office

> Good morning/afternoon [Client Name],
>
> I am emailing you to follow up on our phone call. We received a settlement check in the amount of $[amount] for your case (see attached). In order to distribute this to you, we will need you to endorse this check and get the Settlement Agreement and Release notarized (see attached). We will also need you to get our Power of Attorney notarized (see attached) for us to endorse the check on your behalf and distribute out to you. Once notarized, please email us the documents back in PDF format. If you'd like, we alternatively can help you set up an Online Notary; you just need a webcam. Please let us know how you'd like to proceed. Bart will be sending an email after we receive these documents breaking down the check distribution and confirming your mailing address. Thank you!

#### If Client Did Not Answer (Voicemail + Email)

> Hi [Client Name],
>
> I just gave you a voicemail, but I'm emailing to inform you that we received a settlement check in the amount of [amount] for your case (see attached). In order to distribute this to you, we will need you to endorse this check and get the Settlement Agreement and Release notarized (see attached).
>
> If possible, could you print off the attached release agreement and take it to get notarized? After that, we'd appreciate if you could come into our office to give us the notarized document and so you can endorse the check.
>
> We are located in the 5/3rd building downtown. If that doesn't work for you, please let me know and we can come up with another solution.
>
> Thank you!

## 8. Distribution Statement Preparation

### 8.1 Check the Contract for Fee Percentages

| Scenario | Fee |
|----------|-----|
| Pre-suit settlement (no complaint filed) | Pre-litigation percentage |
| Post-filing settlement (complaint filed) | Litigation percentage |

Look in the client's file to determine if a complaint was filed.

### 8.2 Create Distribution Spreadsheet

Include:
- **Total settlement amount**
- **Attorney's fees** (per contract percentage)
- **Costs / Expenses:**
  - Filing fee (always if complaint filed, usually ~$300)
  - Mailing fees
  - Expert fees
- **Public Adjuster fees** (check PA contract — cannot exceed 10%)
  - ⚠️ PA is the only other party we distribute fees to besides the client
- **Net to client**

### 8.3 Review Process
1. Email the distribution spreadsheet to Bart for review
2. Once approved, email the settlement breakdown to the client
3. Ask for POA if needed
4. Request a Google review

### 8.4 Log in CMS
- Go to the project → Expenses section → New Award
- Enter all settlement data

---

## 10. Release Return & AOD Filing

2. Send the executed release to Opposing Counsel
3. Sign the Agreed Order of Dismissal (AOD) and return to OC
4. Confirm the AOD is filed and entered with the court
5. Confirm all checks clear

---

## 11. Follow-Up & Google Review

Request a Google review from the client. Follow-up schedule:
- 1st request: At settlement distribution
- 2nd follow-up: 1 week later
- 3rd follow-up: 2 weeks after that
- Final follow-up: 1 month after that
