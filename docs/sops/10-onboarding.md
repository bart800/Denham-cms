## 14. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes New Hires Make

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Not reading the SOPs** | Asks questions that are already documented | Read assigned SOPs on schedule; reference them before asking |
| **Saving files to the wrong location** | Documents get lost; team can't find them | Always save to CMS AND OneDrive backup — follow naming conventions |
| **Forgetting to log communications** | No one knows what was said to the client | Log every call, email, and voicemail in CMS Activity section |
| **Giving legal advice** | Unauthorized practice of law | Only attorneys give legal advice — you provide information and updates |
| **Not calendaring immediately** | Deadline gets forgotten | Calendar the moment you learn about a deadline — don't wait |
| **Using personal email for work** | Security risk; no firm records | Always use @denham.law email |
| **Not asking questions** | Mistakes compound silently | Ask early and often — it's expected during onboarding |
| **Trying to fix errors alone** | Small errors become big problems | Escalate immediately — especially for deadlines and client funds |

### 💡 Pro Tips for Getting Up to Speed Fast

- **Take notes** — you'll get a lot of information in Week 1; write it down
- **Bookmark this SOP** — you'll reference it repeatedly
- **Shadow before doing** — watch a paralegal do the task before attempting it yourself
- **Use the SOP as a checklist** — literally check off each step as you do it
- **Ask "why"** — understanding the reason behind a procedure helps you remember it
- **Set up your CMS dashboard** — customize it to show your assigned matters and tasks
- **Learn the naming conventions** early — consistent file names save everyone time
- **Practice in the CMS** — there's no substitute for hands-on experience
- **Keep a "questions" document** — write down questions as they come up and batch them for your mentor
- **Don't be afraid to say "I don't know yet"** — it's better than guessing wrong
