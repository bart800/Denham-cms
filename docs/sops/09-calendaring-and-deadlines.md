## 1. Overview

Calendaring is the lifeblood of the firm. Missing a deadline can result in case dismissal, sanctions, and disciplinary action. Every deadline must be calendared accurately, and every calendar entry must be verified.

⚠️ **Treat the schedule as if your job depends on it — because it does.**

### Property Insurance Cases — Special Rule

⚠️ **For property insurance cases, the SOL is often found in the policy itself** under the "Suit Against Us" or "Legal Action Against Us" provision. This is typically **1 year from the date of denial** but varies by policy. Always check the policy language.

## 4. Date Calculation Rules

### The Rule for Litigation Documents

> **Always start counting on the next business day** from the date you serve or receive a document. **Include weekends** in the count (unless the deadline falls on a weekend/holiday, in which case it extends to the next business day).

### Examples

**Complaint served on 10/07/25:**
- Day 1 = 10/08/25 (next business day)
- 20th day = 10/27/25 (answer due)

**Demand sent on 9/18/24:**
- Count 14 days including weekends
- Deadline = 10/02/24

### Demand Deadlines (Non-Litigation)
- Weekends **DO** count
- Start counting from the day sent

### SOL Calculation
- Start from the **date of the event** (accident, denial, breach)
- End on the **anniversary** of that date (minus appropriate years)
- If anniversary falls on weekend/holiday → extends to next business day

## 5. Calendaring Procedure

### How to Calendar a Deadline

**⏱️ Expected Time: 5 minutes per entry**

1. Go to the client's file in the CMS
2. Open the Calendar section
3. Create a new event:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Use format: `[Type] - [Client Last Name]` (e.g., "Def Demand Payment Due - Smith") |
| **Invite** | Bart Denham only (appears on his calendar) |
| **Date** | Calculated deadline date |
| **All-Day** | ✅ Yes (goes to top of calendar) |
| **Matter** | Verify correct client |
| **Calendar** | Support Staff |
| **Description** | Note when the triggering document was sent/received |

4. Save event → ⚠️ **DO NOT NOTIFY** (no email notification to Bart)

### Standard Calendar Title Formats

| Event Type | Title Format |
|-----------|-------------|
| Demand Payment Due | `Def Demand Payment Due - [Last Name]` |
| Answer Due | `Answer Due from [Carrier] - [Initials]` |
| Discovery Due | `Discovery Due - [Last Name]` |
| SOL Deadline | `SOL DEADLINE - [Last Name]` |
| Trial Date | `TRIAL - [Last Name]` |
| Mediation | `Mediation - [Last Name]` |
| Medical Records Follow-Up | `Med Rec F/U - [Last Name] - [Provider]` |
| PIP Ledger Due | `PIP Ledger Due - [Last Name]` |
| Settlement Check Follow-Up | `Settlement Check F/U - [Last Name]` |
| IOLTA 10-Day Hold Ends | `IOLTA Hold Ends - [Last Name]` |

---

## 6. SOL Tracking & Alerts

- ⚠️ **Calculate the lowest applicable SOL at intake** — do this FIRST
- Calendar the SOL deadline on **both** the assigned attorney's calendar and Bart's calendar
- For property cases: SOL is often found in the policy under "Suit Against Us"
- For PI cases: Varies by state — calculate the most restrictive deadline
- **Set a warning reminder 90 days before SOL** — gives time to file if needed
- **Set a second warning 30 days before SOL** — final alert

→ See [SOP 01 — Intake & Signup](01-intake-and-signup.md) for SOL calculation at intake.  
→ See [SOP 08 — PI Case Lifecycle](08-pi-case-lifecycle.md) for PI-specific SOL considerations.

## 7. Weekly Calendar Audit

**Every Sunday** — review everyone's schedule for the upcoming week **through Monday of the following week** (to catch Monday items that need prep).

**⏱️ Expected Time: 45–90 minutes**

### Audit Steps

For **each** scheduled event:

1. ✅ Ensure the document relating to the calendared event is attached to the event
2. ✅ **Verify accuracy of time and date** — pay close attention to time zone
3. ✅ Verify the event is on the **correct attorney's calendar**
4. ✅ Go to the case in OneDrive **AND** the CMS to ensure:
   - No other dates are missing
   - The event is still scheduled as planned
   - ⚠️ **Pay close attention to pleadings filed with the court** — look for dates and verify events are properly scheduled (creates redundancy to catch errors)
5. ✅ If a Zoom link or phone number is needed:
   - Make a personal calendar event to call the court
   - If any issues arise regarding travel or connection info, **inform the relevant attorney immediately**

### Monthly Audit — SOL Check

Once per month, review **all active cases** and verify:
- SOL is calendared
- SOL date is correct
- Warning reminders (90-day and 30-day) are set
- No SOL is approaching without a plan (demand sent, suit filed, etc.)

### Audit Mindset

> **Take time to do this. There is no need to rush. Accuracy is King.**

Scheduling errors put stress on attorneys and risk sanctions and disciplinary action. Adding redundancy in the scheduling procedure is the best way to ensure mistakes don't happen.

⚠️ **The schedule is the lifeblood of the firm and must be reviewed with a careful eye.**

## 8. Missed Deadline Emergency Procedure

If you discover a deadline has been missed or is about to be missed:

### Immediate Steps (Within 1 Hour)

1. ⚠️ **STOP — Do not try to fix it yourself**
2. **Notify the assigned attorney AND Bart immediately** — call, don't email
3. Provide: case name, deadline type, original deadline date, current status
4. **Document everything** — when you discovered it, what you checked

### Attorney Will Determine

| Situation | Possible Action |
|-----------|----------------|
| Demand deadline missed | Send demand immediately; may not have consequences |
| Discovery deadline missed | File motion for extension; contact OC to stipulate |
| SOL about to expire | Emergency filing required — drop everything |
| SOL already expired | Malpractice exposure — attorney handles immediately |
| Court-ordered deadline missed | Motion to extend; potential sanctions |

### Post-Incident Review

After the crisis is resolved:
1. Determine **why** the deadline was missed
2. Update procedures to prevent recurrence
3. Document the incident and resolution
4. Add additional redundancy checks if needed

## 9. CMS Calendar Integration

### How CMS Calendar Syncs

- CMS calendar events sync to **Outlook/Microsoft 365** calendars
- Events should be created in CMS (not directly in Outlook) so they're linked to the matter
- All-day events appear at the top of the calendar — use this for deadlines

### Best Practices

- **Create events in CMS** so they're tied to the client file
- **Don't create duplicate events** in both CMS and Outlook
- **Use consistent naming conventions** (see Section 5)
- **Verify sync** — after creating an event in CMS, check that it appears in Outlook
- **Link documents** — attach relevant documents to calendar events in CMS

## 10. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Wrong start date for counting** | Deadline is off by 1+ days | Always start counting on the NEXT business day |
| **Forgetting weekends count in litigation deadlines** | Deadline calculation is wrong | Weekends count in the count, but if deadline falls on weekend → next business day |
| **Using wrong SOL for the state** | Could miss the real deadline | Always verify the state-specific SOL; use the table above |
| **Not checking the insurance policy for property SOL** | Policy SOL may be shorter than state SOL | Always read "Suit Against Us" clause |
| **Calendaring on wrong attorney's calendar** | Attorney doesn't see the deadline | Verify the assigned attorney before creating the event |
| **Sending notification when creating event** | Bart gets unnecessary email notifications | Always uncheck "Notify" |
| **Not setting SOL warning reminders** | No advance notice before SOL expires | Set 90-day and 30-day warnings |
| **Relying on memory instead of the calendar** | Humans forget; calendars don't | Calendar EVERYTHING |
| **Not doing weekly audit** | Errors accumulate unchecked | Sunday audit is non-negotiable |
| **Wrong SOL start date (using filing date instead of event date)** | SOL calculated from wrong starting point | SOL runs from the event (accident, denial, breach), not from when we were hired |

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Calendar the deadline AND a follow-up before it** — e.g., "Discovery due in 5 days - Smith" a week before the actual deadline
- **Use the date calculator** every time — don't count days in your head
- **Double-check your math** — have someone else verify critical deadlines (SOL, trial dates)
- **When in doubt, use the shorter deadline** — it's better to be early than late
- **For property cases:** The policy SOL is usually 1 year from denial — read every policy
- **Print the weekly calendar** and tape it to your monitor — visual reminders work
- **Color-code** by deadline type if your calendar supports it (red = SOL, orange = discovery, etc.)
- **Never assume the previous paralegal calendared correctly** — verify everything on case transfer
- **Holiday awareness** — keep a list of court holidays; deadlines that fall on holidays extend to next business day
- **Time zones matter** — if the court is in a different time zone, file by THEIR business hours
