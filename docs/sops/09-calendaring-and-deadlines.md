## 1. Overview

Calendaring is the lifeblood of the firm. Missing a deadline can result in case dismissal, sanctions, and disciplinary action. Every deadline must be calendared accurately, and every calendar entry must be verified.

⚠️ **Treat the schedule as if your job depends on it — because it does.**

## 3. Date Calculation Rules

### The Rule for Litigation Documents

> **Always start counting on the next business day** from the date you serve or receive a document. **Include weekends** in the count (unless the deadline falls on a weekend/holiday, in which case it extends to the next business day).

### Examples

**Complaint served on 10/07/25:**
- Day 1 = 10/08/25 (next business day)
- 20th day = 10/27/25 (answer due)

**Demand sent on 9/18/24:**
- Count 14 days including weekends
- Deadline = 10/02/24

### Demand Deadlines (Non-Litigation)
- Weekends **DO** count
- Start counting from the day sent

## 4. Calendaring Procedure

### How to Calendar a Deadline

1. Go to the client's file in the CMS
2. Open the Calendar section
3. Create a new event:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Use format: `[Type] - [Client Last Name]` (e.g., "Def Demand Payment Due - Smith") |
| **Invite** | Bart Denham only (appears on his calendar) |
| **Date** | Calculated deadline date |
| **All-Day** | ✅ Yes (goes to top of calendar) |
| **Matter** | Verify correct client |
| **Calendar** | Support Staff |
| **Description** | Note when the triggering document was sent/received |

4. Save event → ⚠️ **DO NOT NOTIFY** (no email notification to Bart)

### Standard Calendar Title Formats

| Event Type | Title Format |
|-----------|-------------|
| Demand Payment Due | `Def Demand Payment Due - [Last Name]` |
| Answer Due | `Answer Due from [Carrier] - [Initials]` |
| Discovery Due | `Discovery Due - [Last Name]` |
| SOL Deadline | `SOL DEADLINE - [Last Name]` |
| Trial Date | `TRIAL - [Last Name]` |
| Mediation | `Mediation - [Last Name]` |

---

## 5. SOL Tracking & Alerts

- ⚠️ **Calculate the lowest applicable SOL at intake**
- Calendar the SOL deadline on **both** the assigned attorney's calendar and Bart's calendar
- For property cases: SOL is often found in the policy under "Suit Against Us"
- For PI cases: Varies by state — calculate the most restrictive deadline

---

## 6. Weekly Calendar Audit

**Every Sunday,** review everyone's schedule for the upcoming week **through Monday of the following week** (to catch Monday items that need prep).

### Audit Steps

For **each** scheduled event:

1. ✅ Ensure the document relating to the calendared event is attached to the event
2. ✅ **Verify accuracy of time and date** — pay close attention to time zone
3. ✅ Verify the event is on the **correct attorney's calendar**
4. ✅ Go to the case in OneDrive **AND** the CMS to ensure:
   - No other dates are missing
   - The event is still scheduled as planned
   - ⚠️ **Pay close attention to pleadings filed with the court** — look for dates and verify events are properly scheduled (creates redundancy to catch errors)
5. ✅ If a Zoom link or phone number is needed:
   - Make a personal calendar event to call the court
   - If any issues arise regarding travel or connection info, **inform the relevant attorney immediately**

### Audit Mindset

> **Take time to do this. There is no need to rush. Accuracy is King.**

Scheduling errors put stress on attorneys and risk sanctions and disciplinary action. Adding redundancy in the scheduling procedure is the best way to ensure mistakes don't happen.

⚠️ **The schedule is the lifeblood of the firm and must be reviewed with a careful eye.**
