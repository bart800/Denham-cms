## 1. Overview

Drafting a demand letter is a pre-litigation task. With it, we:
- Alert the insurance carrier that the claim exists and the claimant is prepared to pursue legal action
- Lay the foundation by providing key facts, policy provisions, and establishing liability and causation
- Support our position with evidence (photos, estimates, reports)
- Clearly state the itemized dollar amount and set a deadline for compliance

**Workflow:** Paralegal Draft → Attorney Review → Redraft as needed → Attorney Review → Paralegal Final Review → SEND

⚠️ **Demand first draft should be completed within 5 days of ATR execution.** If delayed, notify Bart.

## 3. Proof of Loss (POL) Preparation

The Sworn Proof of Loss is drafted and sent to the client for signature **while the demand is being drafted**. Signatures must be completed before the demand is sent for review.

### 3.1 Requirements
- Policy with Declarations Page (impossible to complete without it)
- All estimates (to calculate the whole loss and damage value)

### 3.2 Drafting the POL

Use the firm's Sworn POL template (Adobe form). Fill in:

| Field | Where to Find |
|-------|--------------|
| **Policy Number** | Declarations page |
| **Company Claim Number** | Correspondence or client |
| **Policy Amt. at Time of Loss** | "Limits of Liability" on declarations page. If multiple coverages damaged (e.g., dwelling + barn), add Coverage A + Coverage B together. |
| **Date Issued / Date Expires** | Policy Period on declarations page |
| **Agent** | Listed on declarations page as "Agent" or "Representative" (NOT the adjuster) |
| **Agency Address** | Listed with agent name; leave blank if not available |
| **Insurance Company Full Name** | Policy or correspondence → verify on Dept. of Insurance website |
| **Insurance Company Address** | Use address on policy; if unavailable, use Statutory Home Office from Dept. of Insurance |
| **Insured Name(s)** | Check policy — include both names if both are on the policy |
| **Address of Insured** | As listed on the policy |
| **Against loss by** | Cause of loss (Wind/Hail, Fire, Water, etc.) |
| **Hour of Loss** | Leave blank |
| **Date of Loss** | Verify against insurance correspondence |
| **Occupancy** | "Residential" for dwelling damage |
| **Mortgage Company** | Listed on policy — include in Title and Changes section |
| **Loss & Amt. Claimed** | Whole loss value BEFORE deductions (deductible, prior payments) |

### 3.3 POL Tips

⚠️ **Do NOT subtract the deductible or prior payments** from the total amount claimed.

⚠️ **Verify the correct insurance company.** Some companies (like Sedgwick) handle claims on behalf of other insurers. Always look at the certified policy for the real company name. Liberty Mutual handles claims for Wolverine Mutual — don't assume from correspondence.

⚠️ If claiming losses under **multiple coverages**, add the coverage limits together for the total policy amount.

⚠️ If there was a **policy change increasing coverage** during a relevant period, use the original one-year period but the **increased** coverage amount (if loss was after the increase).

Send to Bart for review before sending to the client for signature.

## 4. Demand Letter Structure

### Phase 1: Intake & File Preparation
1. Run the prerequisites checklist
2. Create a **Demands** folder inside the Correspondence folder
3. Copy the demand template and name it "Draft Demand"

### Phase 2: Demand Composition

The demand letter follows this structure:

#### 4.1 Date
- Use Word's auto-updating date feature:
  - Highlight date → Insert → Date and Time → Format: "October 4, 2024" → Check "Update Automatically" → OK

#### 4.2 Adjuster Information / Email
- The adjuster's email is used to serve the demand
- Find it in: correspondence, LOR, client intake form
- If adjuster email unavailable, use the carrier's general email (e.g., `statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com`)
- If both an adjuster email and general email exist, include both

#### 4.3 Reference Line
- Claim Number (from correspondence)
- Policy Number (from correspondence or policy)
- Date of Loss (from correspondence or estimates)
- Insured Name(s) — ⚠️ **Check the policy** to see who is named
- Insured Location — use the **loss location**, not necessarily the client's home address

#### 4.4 Salutation
- Always use **Mr.** or **Ms.** (do not assume marital status)

#### 4.5 Introduction Paragraph
> As you know my firm represents [Insured Name(s)] in the above-referenced dispute. This letter shall serve as insured's [or insureds'] final demand for payment.

#### 4.6 Explaining the Situation
Paragraph structure:

1. **The loss:** When, what event, where
   > "The insureds experienced a covered loss on [date], from a [event] that caused significant damage to their property located at [address]."

2. **The damage:** What was specifically damaged
   > "The [event] caused extensive damage to [specific items] including but not limited to [list major items]."
   - Use "including but not limited to" to avoid listing everything

3. **How the defendant responded:**
   > "The insureds timely filed a claim with [Carrier] who [describe response: denied, underpaid, delayed]."

#### 4.7 Retained Estimates Paragraph
If client retained a PA or contractor:
> "The insureds were forced to retain [Name], a licensed public adjuster, to attempt to receive fair payment of their claim."

⚠️ Only use "forced to retain" for **public adjusters**, not contractors.

> "Upon inspection, [Name] documented [damage areas], estimating $[amount] to restore the [property] to its pre-loss conditions."

> "I have attached a copy of [Company]'s estimate and photo report for your review."

#### 4.8 Main Argument
- This is the longest section and is case-specific
- Develop **specific arguments** based on policy provisions, not generic pleas
- Think about **why** the claim was denied or underpaid
- Use denial letter language against the carrier
- Include relevant expert findings, engineer reports, building code requirements
- Embed high-impact photos using the snipping tool
- Frame water losses as "sudden water loss from a pipe bursting" (slow leaks are generally not covered)

**Conclusion of argument:**
> Restate what the insurance company failed to do or disregarded, and why the full repairs from the estimate are necessary.

#### 4.9 Unfair Claims Settlement Practice Statute
(See [Section 7](#7-state-specific-unfair-claims-statutes) below)

#### 4.10 Proof of Loss Paragraph

**Kentucky:**
> The insureds are providing herein a sworn proof of loss statement on condition. KRS 304.12-235 requires payment within thirty (30) days from submission of a sworn proof of loss statement. [Insurance Company]'s failure to do so makes it liable for additional extra-contractual damages for reimbursement of attorneys' fees and interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.

**All other states:**
> Furthermore, the insureds are hereby submitting a sworn proof of loss statement enclosed herein.

⚠️ This paragraph varies by state. If unsure, add a comment in the Word doc for Bart's review.

#### 4.11 Settlement Breakdown
(See [Section 6](#6-settlement-breakdown-calculation) below)

#### 4.12 Payment Deadline & Check Instructions
(See [Section 12](#12-payment-instructions) below)

#### 4.13 Additional Paragraph — Refusal / Additional Time

> Lastly, if [Insurance Company] refuses to make payment within the time period provided, please provide a reasonable explanation of the basis in the Policy in relation to facts and applicable law for its denial to do so. If [Insurance Company] needs additional time to investigate this claim, please provide a reasonable explanation of basis for such need. If you have any questions or would like to discuss, please feel free to reach out.

#### 4.14 Signature

> Very Truly Yours,
>
> /s/J. Bart Denham
> J. Bart Denham

#### 4.15 Enclosures
List every supporting document. Common enclosures:
- Estimate(s) from PA or contractor
- Expert reports (engineering, shingle identification, etc.)
- Photos / video links
- Sworn Proof of Loss
- Denham Property and Injury Law Firm W9

## 5. Demand Tips & Writing Standards

### Writing Style
- ✅ **ACTIVE voice** and **PROFESSIONAL tone**
- ✅ Insurance companies are **"it"** — never "they" or "insurer"
- ✅ All text in **Times New Roman 12pt**
- ✅ Double-spaced body

### Photo Usage
- Use the **Snippet tool** to embed photos directly in the demand
- Photos strengthen the argument — the carrier will want to see them anyway

**Example of GOOD photo reference:**
> "The insured was forced to retain Public Adjuster, Brandi Carroll to seek fair indemnification. Mrs. Carroll inspected the property and documented the hail damage in her previously provided report. The photographs clearly show hail damage to roof shingles, notably punctures in the ridge caps. I've enclosed a copy of the report for your reference."

**BAD:**
> "The roof has clearly sustained hail damage, as shown in the estimate with photos, provided by Public Adjuster, Brandi Carroll."

### General Tips
- If we have an engineer's report, mention it
- Don't just say what the insurance company paid — develop specific arguments based on policy provisions
- If you find missing information, ask the team or get permission to discuss with the client/PA
- Try to complete as much as possible before sending to Bart for review
- Include comments in Word for questions; if too many questions are blocking progress, raise them in the daily meeting

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ⚠️ Missing or mislabeled exhibits
- ⚠️ Inconsistent dollar figures between narrative and settlement table
- ⚠️ Wrong policy form / endorsement cited
- ⚠️ Misdated loss or policy period
- ⚠️ Forgetting deductible or prior payments in net demand
- ⚠️ Assuming extra documents we don't have

## 6. Settlement Breakdown Calculation

The breakdown consists of (if applicable):

| Item | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Estimate(s) for repairs** | May have multiple estimates |
| **Prior payments** | Amount already paid by carrier (subtract) |
| **Deductible** | Found in the policy (subtract) |
| **Contents** | Usually in fire claims; any claim with lost personal items |
| **Additional Living Expenses (ALE)** | If client displaced from home |
| **Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Interest, Bad Faith Release** | Added after Bart's review |

### Formula
```
Total = Estimates - Deductible - Prior Payments + ALE + Contents + [Attorneys' Fees if applicable]
```

### Examples

**Example 1 — Simple:**
```
Winning the Claim Public Adjusters Estimate     $80,187.07
Deductible                                      ($ 1,048.01)
                                                -----------
Total Due for Coverage A & B                    $79,139.06
```

**Example 2 — Multiple items:**
```
Central Kentucky Restoration Estimates          $84,946.33
ALE                                             $ 9,869.22
Contents                                        $32,048.31
Prior Payments                                 ($35,350.12)
Deductible                                     ($ 1,000.00)
                                                -----------
Total Demand Due                                $90,513.74
```

**Example 3 — With attorneys' fees:**
```
Brandi Carroll Public Adjuster Estimate         $28,614.80
Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Interest, Bad Faith     $25,000.00
Deductible                                     ($ 1,000.00)
                                                -----------
Total Demand                                    $52,614.80
```

⚠️ **Calculate the breakdown 3 TIMES.** Triple-check the math.

## 7. State-Specific Unfair Claims Statutes

Include the appropriate statute in every demand. Omit individual acts that don't apply to the case.

### Kentucky — KRS 304.12-230

### Other States

The statute language is similar across states but wording differs. Look up the specific state's Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act:
- **Casetext** or **Justia** for the specific statute
- Although each statute has ~17 acts, we typically cite only the ones listed above
- **Omit** acts that don't apply (e.g., #2 if the carrier responded promptly)
