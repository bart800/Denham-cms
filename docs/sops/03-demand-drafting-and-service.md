## 1. Overview

Drafting a demand letter is a pre-litigation task. With it, we:
- Alert the insurance carrier that the claim exists and the claimant is prepared to pursue legal action
- Lay the foundation by providing key facts, policy provisions, and establishing liability and causation
- Support our position with evidence (photos, estimates, reports)
- Clearly state the itemized dollar amount and set a deadline for compliance

**Workflow:** Paralegal Draft → Attorney Review → Redraft as needed → Attorney Review → Paralegal Final Review → SEND

⚠️ **Demand first draft should be completed within 5 days of ATR execution.** If delayed, notify Bart.

## 4. Proof of Loss (POL) Preparation

**⏱️ Expected Time: 30 minutes**

The Sworn Proof of Loss is drafted and sent to the client for signature **while the demand is being drafted**. Signatures must be completed before the demand is sent for review.

### 4.1 Requirements
- Policy with Declarations Page (impossible to complete without it)
- All estimates (to calculate the whole loss and damage value)

### 4.2 Drafting the POL

Use the firm's Sworn POL template (Adobe form). Fill in:

| Field | Where to Find | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Policy Number** | Declarations page | `000930969788` |
| **Company Claim Number** | Correspondence or client | `0709368203` |
| **Policy Amt. at Time of Loss** | "Limits of Liability" on dec page | `$250,000` |
| **Date Issued / Date Expires** | Policy Period on dec page | `01/15/2024 - 01/15/2025` |
| **Agent** | Listed on dec page as "Agent" (NOT the adjuster) | `John Smith, Allstate Agent` |
| **Agency Address** | Listed with agent name; leave blank if not available | — |
| **Insurance Company Full Name** | Policy → verify on Dept. of Insurance | `Allstate Indemnity Company` |
| **Insurance Company Address** | Policy; if unavailable, Statutory Home Office | `PO Box 672041, Dallas, TX 75265` |
| **Insured Name(s)** | Check policy — include both if both are listed | `George D. Bonilla and Tammy R. Bonilla` |
| **Address of Insured** | As listed on the policy | `102 Frankie Dr., Richmond, KY 40475` |
| **Against loss by** | Cause of loss | `Wind/Hail` |
| **Date of Loss** | Verify against correspondence | `March 3, 2023` |
| **Occupancy** | Usually "Residential" | `Residential` |
| **Mortgage Company** | Listed on policy — include in Title and Changes | `US Bank` |
| **Loss & Amt. Claimed** | Whole loss BEFORE deductions | `$25,480.29` |

### 4.3 POL Tips

⚠️ **Do NOT subtract the deductible or prior payments** from the total amount claimed. The POL states the WHOLE loss value.

⚠️ **Verify the correct insurance company.** Some companies handle claims on behalf of others:
- **Sedgwick** handles claims for other insurers — check the certified policy
- **Liberty Mutual** handles claims for Wolverine Mutual
- Don't assume from correspondence — always verify on the policy

⚠️ If claiming losses under **multiple coverages** (e.g., dwelling + barn), add Coverage A + Coverage B limits together for the total policy amount.

⚠️ If there was a **policy change increasing coverage** during a relevant period, use the original one-year period but the **increased** coverage amount.

Send to Bart for review before sending to the client for signature.

## 5. Demand Letter Structure

### Phase 1: Intake & File Preparation
1. Run the prerequisites checklist (Section 2)
2. Create a **Demands** folder inside the Correspondence folder
3. Copy the appropriate demand template and name it "Draft Demand"

### Phase 2: Demand Composition

#### 5.1 Date
- Use Word's auto-updating date feature:
  - Highlight date → Insert → Date and Time → Format: "October 4, 2024" → Check "Update Automatically" → OK

#### 5.2 Adjuster Information / Email
- The adjuster's email is used to serve the demand
- Find it in: correspondence, LOR, client intake form
- If adjuster email unavailable, use the carrier's general email (e.g., `statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com`)
- If both an adjuster email and general email exist, include both

#### 5.3 Reference Line

```
Re: Claim Number: 0709368203
    Policy Number: 000930969788
    Date of Loss: March 3, 2023
    Insured(s): George D. Bonilla and Tammy R. Bonilla
    Insured Location: 102 Frankie Dr., Richmond, KY 40475
```

⚠️ **Insured Names** — Check the policy to see who is named. Don't just use who signed the ATR.
⚠️ **Insured Location** — Use the **loss location**, not necessarily the client's mailing address.

#### 5.4 Salutation
- Always use **Mr.** or **Ms.** (do not assume marital status)

#### 5.5 Introduction Paragraph

> As you know my firm represents George Bonilla and Tammy Bonilla in the above-referenced dispute. This letter shall serve as the insureds' final demand for payment.

#### 5.6 Explaining the Situation

**Paragraph 1 — The Loss:**
> The insureds suffered a covered loss on or about March 3, 2023, due to a severe hail and wind storm that impacted their property at 102 Frankie Dr., Richmond, KY 40475. The dwelling sustained significant damage, including but not limited to the roof and HVAC system. The insureds promptly filed a claim with Allstate, which inspected the property and initially estimated the cost of repairs at $3,335.48.

**Paragraph 2 — Retained Estimates:**
> The insureds retained Alliance Roofing and Contracting to repair the roof and HVAC at an incurred cost of $25,480.29. The full scope and cost of repairs is laid out in the contractor's estimate and has been incurred by the insured. I have attached a copy of the estimate for your reference.

⚠️ Only use "forced to retain" for **public adjusters**, not contractors.

**Paragraph 3+ — Main Argument:**

This is the longest section and is **case-specific**. Here's a real example from the Bonilla demand:

> Even though Allstate provided payment for a full roof replacement, the amount covered was considerably lower than the total cost quoted by the contractor to complete the entire roof replacement. Allstate's estimate primarily focuses on removing and replacing damaged roof components, such as shingles, flashing, roof vents, and drip edges, but omits critical items necessary for a proper roof replacement, such as synthetic felt, chimney flashing, and starter shingles.
>
> Allstate also failed to include in their estimate the HVAC replacement, initially denying its replacement and later only agreeing to pay for a repair, despite the contractor determining that a full replacement was necessary.

**For roof damage cases in KY, cite 806 KAR 12:095 Section 9(1)(b):**

> As required by 806 KAR 12:095 Section 9(1)(b), "If a loss requires replacement of items and the replaced items do not reasonably match in quality, color, and size, the insurer shall replace all items in the area so as to conform to a reasonably uniform appearance. This applies to interior and exterior losses. The insured shall not bear any cost over the applicable deductible."

#### 5.7 Unfair Claims Settlement Practice Statute
→ See [Section 8](#8-state-specific-unfair-claims-statutes) below

#### 5.8 Proof of Loss Paragraph

**Kentucky:**
> The insureds are providing herein a sworn proof of loss statement on condition. KRS 304.12-235 requires payment within thirty (30) days from submission of a sworn proof of loss statement. [Insurance Company]'s failure to do so makes it liable for additional extra-contractual damages for reimbursement of attorneys' fees and interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.

**Montana:**
> Furthermore, the insureds are hereby submitting a sworn proof of loss statement enclosed herein. [Insurance Company]'s failure to pay within a reasonable time will expose it to additional liability for damages under Montana law.

**All other states:**
> Furthermore, the insureds are hereby submitting a sworn proof of loss statement enclosed herein.

⚠️ This paragraph varies by state. If unsure, add a comment in the Word doc for Bart's review.

#### 5.9 Settlement Breakdown
→ See [Section 7](#7-settlement-breakdown-calculation) below

#### 5.10 Payment Deadline & Check Instructions
→ See [Section 14](#14-payment-instructions) below

#### 5.11 Additional Paragraph — Refusal / Additional Time

> Lastly, if [Insurance Company] refuses to make payment within the time period provided, please provide a reasonable explanation of the basis in the Policy in relation to facts and applicable law for its denial to do so. If [Insurance Company] needs additional time to investigate this claim, please provide a reasonable explanation of basis for such need. If you have any questions or would like to discuss, please feel free to reach out.

## 7. Settlement Breakdown Calculation

The breakdown consists of (if applicable):

| Item | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Estimate(s) for repairs** | May have multiple estimates |
| **Prior payments** | Amount already paid by carrier (subtract) |
| **Deductible** | Found in the policy (subtract) |
| **Contents** | Usually in fire claims; any claim with lost personal items |
| **Additional Living Expenses (ALE)** | If client displaced from home |
| **Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Interest, Bad Faith Release** | Added after Bart's review |

### Formula
```
Total = Estimates - Deductible - Prior Payments + ALE + Contents + [Attorneys' Fees if applicable]
```

### Real Examples from Our Cases

**Example 1 — Simple (Bonilla v. Allstate, Wind/Hail):**
```
Alliance Roofing and Contracting Estimate       $25,480.29
Prior Payments                                  ($ 7,644.06)
                                                 -----------
Total Demand                                     $17,836.23
```

                                                 -----------
Total Demand Due                                 $90,513.74
```

**Example 3 — With attorneys' fees:**
```
Brandi Carroll Public Adjuster Estimate          $28,614.80
Attorneys' Fees, Costs, Interest, Bad Faith      $25,000.00
Deductible                                      ($ 1,000.00)
                                                 -----------
Total Demand                                     $52,614.80
```

**Example 4 — PA estimate only, no deductible waived:**
```
Winning the Claim Public Adjusters Estimate      $80,187.07
Deductible                                      ($ 1,048.01)
                                                 -----------
Total Due for Coverage A & B                     $79,139.06
```

⚠️ **Calculate the breakdown 3 TIMES.** Triple-check the math. One wrong number undermines the entire demand.

## 9. Demand Tips & Writing Standards

### Writing Style
- ✅ **ACTIVE voice** and **PROFESSIONAL tone**
- ✅ Insurance companies are **"it"** — never "they" or "insurer"
- ✅ All text in **Times New Roman 12pt**
- ✅ Double-spaced body

### Photo Usage
- Use the **Snippet tool** to embed photos directly in the demand
- Photos strengthen the argument — the carrier will want to see them anyway

**Example of GOOD photo reference:**
> "The insured was forced to retain Public Adjuster Brandi Carroll to seek fair indemnification. Mrs. Carroll inspected the property and documented the hail damage in her previously provided report. The photographs clearly show hail damage to roof shingles, notably punctures in the ridge caps. I've enclosed a copy of the report for your reference."

**BAD:**
> "The roof has clearly sustained hail damage, as shown in the estimate with photos, provided by Public Adjuster Brandi Carroll."

### General Tips
- If we have an engineer's report, mention it and attach it
- Don't just say what the insurance company paid — develop **specific arguments** based on policy provisions
- If you find missing information, ask the team or get permission to discuss with the client/PA
- Try to complete as much as possible before sending to Bart for review
- Include comments in Word for questions; if too many questions are blocking progress, raise them in the daily meeting

## 16. Common Mistakes & Pro Tips

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong insurance company name** — "State Farm" ≠ "State Farm Fire and Casualty Company." Always verify on the policy AND the Dept. of Insurance website.
2. **Dollar amounts don't match** — The narrative says $25,480 but the breakdown says $25,408. Triple-check.
3. **Wrong statute for the state** — Using KRS in an Indiana demand. Copy from the correct section above.
4. **Forgetting to subtract prior payments** — If Allstate already paid $7,644.06, your demand should net that out.
5. **Forgetting the deductible** — Or subtracting it when it should be included (varies by demand strategy — ask Bart).
6. **Misdated loss or policy period** — Verify against MULTIPLE sources (correspondence, policy, client).
7. **Missing or mislabeled enclosures** — If the demand references "the attached estimate" but the enclosures list doesn't include it, you'll look careless.
8. **Using "they" for the insurance company** — Insurance companies are "it." Always.
9. **Not updating the date when drafting spans multiple days** — If you started Monday and finish Wednesday, the date and deadline must reflect Wednesday.
10. **Sending the demand with Word comments still visible** — Remove ALL comments before converting to PDF.

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Read 2-3 completed demands from the Demands folder** before writing your first one. The best teacher is seeing what Bart approved.
2. **For roof damage, always cite 806 KAR 12:095 § 9(1)(b)** — the matching requirement. Carriers hate this regulation because it usually means a full roof replacement.
3. **Embed photos** — A picture of hail damage with punctured ridge caps is worth 1,000 words of argument.
4. **Frame water losses carefully** — "Sudden water loss from a pipe bursting" is covered. "Slow leak over time" is generally NOT. Word choice matters.
5. **Use the denial letter against them** — If the carrier's own letter says "we inspected and found no damage," but photos show clear damage, quote their letter and show the contradiction.
6. **Keep a running list of "commonly asked" Bart feedback** — If Bart keeps correcting the same things, note them and check for those first.
7. **The POL and demand should be drafted in parallel** — Don't wait for the signed POL to start the demand. Draft both, get POL signed, then merge.
